      I spent Wednesday 14 August 2019 (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Ramer Lake looking through the large number of
herons and ibis. From Ramer Lake I drove northward through Calipatria to
the IID Wetlands, spending some time around the northeast corner of the
Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands I continued north into Niland. In Niland I
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and
south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott
and English Roads and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. From there I drove
south on Davis Road to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis
Roads, then southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From
Morton Bay I drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I spent a little time around the
Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill. I then
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From Unit 1 I drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at the area of shallow water at the
intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86. In Brawley I quickly looked for
birds in Riverview Cemetery. I then drove south to the southeast corner of
El Centro, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.

degrees.
