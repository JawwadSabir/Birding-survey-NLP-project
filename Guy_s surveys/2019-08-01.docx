      I spent Thursday 1 August 2019 (5:45 AM to 5:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley ware
joined by Curtis A. Marantz. We then drove north to Ramer Lake (south
section mostly dry with many herons). From Ramer Lake we continued
northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands we
continued north into Niland. In Niland we birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there we drove northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and
Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. From there we drove south on Davis Road
to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then
southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay (large numbers of
shorebirds). From Morton Bay we drove southwestward by way of Garst and
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. We spent a
little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the ponds
adjacent to Rock Hill. We then checked for water birds along the shore of
the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte,
and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. We then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge,
spending time there sorting through shorebirds. From Unit 1 we drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley we quickly
looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, after which Curtis departed. I then
looked at Jeffrey Thornton Park, then drove south to the southeast corner
of El Centro, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
