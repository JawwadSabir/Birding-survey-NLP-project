      I spent Wednesday, 18 July 2018 (5:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley where I
quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then drove
north to Ramer Lake, stopping at Riverview Cemetery as I left Brawley. From
Ramer Lake I continued northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland. From
there I continued northward into Niland where I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. I
then drove northwestward by way Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. After
birding around the Wister Unit HQ I drove south through the Wister Unit on
Davis Road and west on Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay, stopping to look at the
wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. I then drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the
north end of Poe Road. From there I drove southeastward through Westmorland
into Brawley, then south by way of Brandt, Webster, Forrester and Ross
Roads to Sunbeam Lake, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on the way. From there
I drove south to Lakeview Golfcourse and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      There was cloud-cover throughout the morning and early afternoon, then
partial cloud-cover for the rest of the day, with wind from the east most
of the day, high humidity, and with temperatures ranging from 85 to 100
degrees.
