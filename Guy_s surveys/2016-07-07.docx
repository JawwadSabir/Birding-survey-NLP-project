      I spent most of Wednesday, 6 July 2016 (5:30 AM-2:30 PM) in the
Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I
started the day with a brief stop in Brawley to look at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue. I then proceeded northward to Ramer Lake,
spending some time here, then on northward through Calipatria to Niland. In
Niland I birded north along International Avenue, then westward along 4th
Street and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of
Pound, Davis Roads and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and
checked for birds on Morton Bay. I then drove southward to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. From here I checked for water
birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte
southwestward to the west end of Young Road, spending time in the area
around Obsidian Butte and the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. I
then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From here I drove south eastward
through Westmorland into Brawley, spending a little time in the southwest
portion of Brawley. I then proceeded southwestward to the intersection of
Carter and Fites Roads, then southward, stopping briefly at Sunbeam Lake,
Lakeview Golf Course and Fig Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley. It
was clear, with little to no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 80 to
105 degrees.
