      I spent Thursday, 23 August 2016 (6:00 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day Ramer Lake, then moving on northward through Calipatria to the IID
Wetlands near Niland. I then proceeded northward to Niland where I birded
north along International Avenue, then westward along 4th Street and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way Pound, Davis
Roads and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for
birds on Morton Bay. I then moved southwestward to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ and checked for birds around Rock Hill. From here I
checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Obsidian
Butte southwestward to the west end of Young Road, spending the most time
in the areas around the eastern side of Obsidian Butte and the intersection
of Lack and Lindsey Roads. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and on westward to the north end of Poe
Road. From here I drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley and
spent time at Cattle Call Park and elsewhere in the southwest portion of
Brawley. I then proceeded southward along Forrester and Ross Roads to
Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golf Course and Fig Lagoon before leaving the
Imperial Valley. It was clear with little to no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 75 to 105 degrees.
