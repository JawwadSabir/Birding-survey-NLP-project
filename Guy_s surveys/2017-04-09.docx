      I spent Sunday, 9 April 2017 (6:15 AM to 5:15 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north into Brawley, stopping along the way at
Sheldon Reservoir and in the area near the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads. I stopping briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue in
Brawley, then looked around part of southwestern Brawley and Cattle Call
Park. I then drove north to Niland, stopping at the east end of Date Street
in Calipatria on the way. In Niland I birded quickly northward along
International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then south on Garst and west on
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill.
I then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from
Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte and, from Obsidian Butte along the south shore
of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge,
spending a little time in the area around the intersection of Lack and
Lindsey Roads and at the west end of Young Road. I then drove southeastward
through Westmorland into Brawley, then south on Dogwood Road to near the
southeastern corner of El Centro. After spending time in El Centro, I drove
west, and looked at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before heading west
to San Diego.
      There was high cloud-cover through the day, with light winds,
strongest in the late morning, and with temperatures ranging from 50 to 80
degrees.
      Numbers of ducks and shorebirds have declined in the last week, but
migrant passerines were more in evidence.
