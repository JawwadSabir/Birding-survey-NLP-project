      I spent Friday, 23 September 2016 (6:30 AM-5:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at IID Wetlands near Niland, then continued northward into Niland where
I birded north along International Avenue, west along the western part of
4th Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way
of Alcott, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and
checked for birds on Morton Bay. I then moved southwestward to the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along the
shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte. From here I
checked the shore of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the north end of
Poe Road, spending time in the area around the intersection of Lack and
Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge. I then drove southeastward through Westmorland
into Brawley, and spent time in Riverview Cemetery, at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call Park. From here I proceeded
southward by way of Dogwood Road to the southeast corner of El Centro where
I spent about one hour, then drove west to Lakeview Golf Course, and ended
the day at and Fig Lagoon. It was clear with some wind in the late morning,
and with temperatures ranging from 65 to 90 degrees.
      Numbers of flycatchers, along with Yellow and Wilson’s Warblers, had
dropped since 18 September, but Orange-crowned Warbler numbers appeared to
have increased.
