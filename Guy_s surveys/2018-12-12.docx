      I spent Wednesday, 12 December 2018 (6:30 AM to 4:00 PM) checking a
few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I started the day at Sheldon Reservoir, then drove northward by
way of Forrester and Carter Roads into Brawley. In Brawley I looked briefly
at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spent a little time at
Cattle Call Park (remarkably few birds in evidence). I then continued
northward to the area immediately west of Calipatria, stopping to look at
Young and Veil Reservoirs on the way. From there I continued northward by
way of English and Sinclair Roads and Highway 111 to Niland, stopping at
the northeastern corner of the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded
north along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along
Luna Avenue. I then drove westward to Morton Bay by way of Alcott, English,
Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads. From Morton Bay I drove southwestward by
way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking
at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea
between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and between
Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. I then drove east to Wiest
Lake, then south into Brawley, and on south by way of Forrester and Ross
Roads to Sunbeam Lake, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.

ranging from 45 to 70 degrees.

recent heavy rain.
