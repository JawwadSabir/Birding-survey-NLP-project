         30 June 2017 - Salton Sea/Imperial Valley, Imperial County.

      I spent Friday, 30 June 2017 (5:15 AM to 5:00 PM) birding a few select
locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I started the day at the IID Wetlands southwest of Niland. From
here I moved north into Niland where I was joined by Curtis A. Marantz. We
then birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street,
then south along Luna Avenue. We then drove southwestward by way of Alcott,
English, Pound. Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From here we drove
south on Garst and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending time at the Refuge HQ’s and Rock Hill,
we checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea between
the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte. We then drove to the
north end of Poe Road and worked northeastward along the shore, spending
time at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and looking along
the shore from the west end of Young Road to Obsidian Butte. We then drove
east on Sinclair Road to Highway 111. At Highway 111 CAM headed north and I
drove southward, stopping to look at Ramer Lake, and Riverview Cemetery and
the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue in Brawley. I then moved south by
way of Carter, Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake and Lakeview
Golfcourse, stopping in the area of the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads on the way, and looking over Fig Lagoon before continuing west to San
Diego.
      The sky was clear with virtually no wind most of the day, and with
temperatures ranging from 70 to 110 degrees.

      Shortly after arriving at an irrigated recently cut grass field on
the south side Sinclair Road between English Road and Highway 111, Curtis
A. Marantz drew my attention to a nearby adult Glossy Ibis with an injured
right leg. This Piegadis was actively feeding with a tight group of about a
dozen White-faced Ibis, thus allowing direct comparison between the two
species. As CAM approached with camera in hand. it flushed with other birds
and landed in the northeast corner of the field. I was then able to study
it from my vehicle parked on Sinclair Road. The glossy dark chestnut and
iridescent green body and wing feathering on the Glossy Ibis matched that
on the accompanying adult White-faced Ibis, other than the iridescent green
on the crown was more noticeable. The only obvious difference between the
Glossy and the White-faced Ibis was the pattern and coloration of the face.
The featherless facial-skin on the Glossy Ibis was dark gray to blackish
with well-defined pale blue stripes along the upper and lower edges, these
striped not extending backward to behind the eyes, instead of the reddish
facial-skin completely bordered by white feathering, including around the
rear of the eyes, as on the White-faced Ibis. In addition, the eyes of the
Glossy Ibis were dark rather than reddish as on the White-faced Ibis. The
bill was a pale gray-brown similar to that on the White-faced Ibis, and the
legs were also a pale gray-brown, a darker at the joints.
      The Glossy Ibis is now a very rare to casual stray to California,
with about ten individuals found around the southern edge of the Salton Sea
after the first in California was photographed there on 27 May 2000, the
most recent being an adult near the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ
on 20 June 2015.
