      I spent Saturday, 22 July 2017 (5:30 AM to 4:30 PM) birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of
the Salton Sea. I started the day in the area at the intersection of Carter
and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then moved north into Brawley where I
looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then drove northward
to Ramer Lake, the IID Wetlands, and into Niland. In Niland I birded
northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south
along Luna Avenue. I then drove northwestward by way of Alcott, English and
Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. From here I drove southward by way of
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay and the north end of Garst Road,
stopping briefly at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. From here I
drove south on Garst and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time at Rock Hill, I checked
for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea between the west end
of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west
end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge. From here I drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley where I looked briefly at Riverside Cemetery,
Cattle Call Park and Jeffery Thornton Park. I then drove southwestward by
way of Keystone, Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake and Lakeview
Golfcourse, then looked over Fig Lagoon before continuing west to San
Diego.
      It clear, with no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 85 to 110
degrees.
      No terns of skimmers were seen on nests at Rock Hill, indicating those
few pairs that had already successfully hatched young were the only birds
that will manage to do so this summer. The presence of a wet and muddy
Bobcat may have been one of the predators causing the massive nest failures
at this site. Western Kingbird numbers appeared to have increased during
the last week, Ash-throated Flycatchers have obviously arrived in the area,
and Bullock’s Orioles were much in evidence, suggesting all three of these
species are on the move.
