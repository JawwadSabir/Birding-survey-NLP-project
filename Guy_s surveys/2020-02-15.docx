      I spent Saturday 15 February 2020 (6:15 AM to 4:15 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley. In Brawley I
looked briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, spent time in
Cattle Call Park, and quickly look at Riverview Cemetery. From Brawley I
drove northwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge.
After spending time at Unit 1, I drove westward to Poe Road (muddy
conditions blocked access to the north end of the road). I then drove
northeastward and checked the shoreline from the west end of Young Road to
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After looking around the
visitor center and the area around Rock Hill, I drove northeastward to
Niland, stopping at the north end of Garst Road and the area around the
intersection of Pound and Davis Roads on the way. In Niland I looked only
for birds along the southern end of International Avenue. From Niland I
headed south, stopping at the Calipatria State Prison, Wiest Lake, the
wetlands at the intersection of Dogwood and Keystone Roads, and at the
Branches Hunt Club along Dogwood Road south of Keystone Road. I then drove
southwestward to Fig Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake
on the way.

from 45 to 75 degrees.
