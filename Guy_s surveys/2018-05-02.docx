      I spent Wednesday, 2 May 2018 (5:45 AM to 5:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Ramer Lake. From there I drove northward through
Calipatria, stopping only to look for gulls at the west end of Date Street
in Calipatria (none present) to the IID Wetlands south of Niland. I then
continued northward into Niland where I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove northwestward by way of English Road and Highway 111 to
the Wister Unit HQ. From there I drove south through the Wister Unit on
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst
and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock
Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between
the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte
to the west end of Young Road, and southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. I then drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I quickly looked
at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. From there I drove southward
by way of Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro. After
spending more than one-hour there I headed west, stopping briefly at
Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon.
      There was much cloud-cover with a light wind in the morning and
stronger wind in the late afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 50
to 75 degrees.
      Migrant passerines were much in evidence, with impressive numbers of
Wilson’s Warblers, Western Tanagers and especially Black-headed Grosbeaks
throughout most of the Imperial Valley.
