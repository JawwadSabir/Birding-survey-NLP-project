      I spent Wednesday, 23 January 2019 (6:15 AM to 4:15 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
before sunrise, then moved westward to the north end of Poe Road, stopping
to look at Carter Reservoir on the way. After spending more than an hour at
Poe Road (large numbers of waterbirds), I returned to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From there I moved northeastward to the
northeast edge of the New River and worked my way northeastward along the
shore of the Salton Sea to Obsidian Butte. I then looked for birds around
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and at Rock Hill. From there I
continued northeastward to the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads by way
of Sinclair, Garst and Schrimpf Roads. I then drove eastward to the area
around the Calipatria State Prison, then southwestward to the area
immediately west of Calipatria. From there I drove to Young Reservoir and
on south to Ramer Lake and into Brawley. In Brawley I looked at Riverview
Cemetery, stopped at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, and spent
some time in Cattle Call Park. I then continued southward by way of Carter
and Forrester Roads to Sheldon Reservoir. I then continued south by way of
Forrester Road and west on Ross Road to Sunbeam Lake, and ended the day at
Fig Lagoon.
      Clear sky with no wind throughout the day, and with temperatures
ranging from 40 to 65 degrees.
      The presence of hunters at some locations, and the conditions of some
dirt roads restricted access to a few locations.
