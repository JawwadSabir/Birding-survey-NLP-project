      I spent Sunday, 24 June 2018 (5:30 AM to 4:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
then drove westward to the north end of Poe Road. From there I drove
northeastward to the west end of Young Road. I then checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Young Road and
Obsidian Butte (very few birds along this stretch of the shore) and between
Obsidian Butte and the west end of Sinclair Road. From there I drove
northeastward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending
a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I
drove eastward to Morton Bay by way of Sinclair and Garst Roads. I then
drove northward to the Wister Unit HQ by way of Schrimpf and Davis Roads.
From there I drove southeastward into Niland where I checked for birds
along 4th Street and International Avenue. I then drove south through
Calipatria to Ramer Lake, and on south into Brawley where I looked at
Riverview Cemetery and Cattle Call Park. I then drove southward by way of
Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig
Lagoon.
      It was clear with no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 70 to
105 degrees.
      I spent much of the morning concentrating on shorebirds and managed to
see a nice variety of early southbound migrants. Despite looking, I saw no
raptors, and, as expected, Passerines were less conspicuous around mid-day
than they would be in the early morning.
