      I spent Saturday, 12 November 2016 (6:15 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golf Course and Sunbeam Lake, then continued
northward to Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir, and at the area around
the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way. In Brawly I looked
briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue then departed (roads
closed because of rodeo parade), I continued northward to Niland, stopping
at the algae farm adjacent to Highway 111 south of Sinclair Road and at the
willows at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I
birded north along International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th
Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of
Alcott, Pound, Davis, Schrimpf, Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along the
shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and, joined
by Olaf Soltau from New York, from Obsidian Butte along the south shore of
the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending time in the area
around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young
Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I then
drove southeastward to Westmorland, then southward by way of Forrester Road
to Fig Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way.
It was mostly overcast with virtually no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 50 to 85 degrees.
      Hunting activities in the area around Niland and the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge restricted my access to some locations.
