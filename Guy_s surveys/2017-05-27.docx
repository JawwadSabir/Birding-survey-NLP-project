      I spent Saturday, 27 May 2017 (5:30 AM to 6:00 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north to the area around the intersection of
Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley. I then continued north,
through Brawley, to Ramer Lake. From here I continued north to Niland,
stopping at the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott,
English, Beach and Davis Roads to the southwestern corner of the Wister
Unit. From here I drove south along Davis and west along Schrimpf Roads to
Morton Bay, then south on Garst and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I then looked briefly around the Refuge
HQ’s and Rock Hill. From here I checked for water birds along the shoreline
of the Salton Sea between Rock Hill and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian
Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge, spending a little time in the area around the
intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads and at the west end of Young Road.
From Unit 1 I drove southeastward through Westmorland and Brawley, then
south on Dogwood Road to near the southeastern corner of El Centro. After
spending time near El Centro, I drove west and looked at Fig Lagoon before
continuing west to San Diego.
      The sky was clear with some a light breeze part of the day, and with
temperatures ranging from 65 to 95 degrees.
