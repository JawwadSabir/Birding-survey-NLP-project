      I spent Wednesday, 3 October 2018 (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in Brawley where I looked at the hummingbird feeders
on Willard Avenue, at Cattle Call Park and in the residential area north of
the park. I was then joined by Curtis A. Marantz and John Kvamback and
looked for passerines in Riverview Cemetery. We then drove north to Ramer
Lake and onward to the area immediately west of Calipatria. From there we
continued northward on English and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From there
we drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and between Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. We then
drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
and the north end of Poe Road (large numbers of small shorebirds still
present). From there we drove southeastward into Brawley, and I then drove
south on Forrester Road, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir, and ended
the day at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon.

temperatures ranging from 70 to 95 degrees.
