      I spent Friday, 5 August 2016 (5:45 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial Valley
and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the day in
the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of
Brawley, then proceeded northward to Ramer Lake, spending a short time
there, then moving on northward through Calipatria to Niland. In Niland I
birded north along International Avenue, then westward along 4th Street and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of the IID
Wetlands, Pound, Davis Roads and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst
Road and checked for birds on Morton Bay. I then moved southwestward to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and checked for birds around Rock
Hill. From here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton
Sea from Obsidian Butte southwestward to the west end of Young Road,
spending the most time in the areas around Obsidian Butte and the
intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. I then drove southwestward to Unit
1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and on westward to the north
end of Poe Road. From here I drove south eastward through Westmorland into
Brawley, spending a little time at Cattle Call Park and elsewhere in the
southwest portion of Brawley. I then proceeded southward along Forrester
Road, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golf
Course and Fig Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley. It was partially
cloudy, particularly so in the afternoon, with little to no wind, and with
temperatures ranging from 85 to 110 degrees.
