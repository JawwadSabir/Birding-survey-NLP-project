      I spent Friday 22 March (6:45 AM to 6:30 PM) with Therese R. Clawson
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse
and Sunbeam Lake, then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping to look at
Sheldon Reservoir and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads on the way. In Brawley we looked for birds at Cattle Call Park. From
Brawley we drove northwestward through Westmorland to Poe Road, then
eastward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From there
we drove northeastward to the west end of Young Road and looked for birds
along the south shore of the Salton Sea northeastward to Obsidian Butte. We
then continued eastward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the
freshwater ponds at Rock Hill. We then drove southeastward by way of
Sinclair, Brant and Eddins Roads to the area (intersection of Sperry and
Bowles Roads) immediately west of Calipatria. From there we drove southward
into Brawley, stopping at Ramer Lake on the way, then south on Dogwood Road
to near the southeast corner of El Centro. After spending time there, we
drove westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Clear sky throughout the day with no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 55 to 75 degrees.

      The two (2) Violet-green Swallows were well studied with the aid of
my telescope as the perched with Tree, Rough-winged and Barn Swallows on
utility lines at Sunbeam Lake shortly after sunrise. I clearly saw that
these two swallows were slightly smaller than the Tree Swallows nearby,
that the white on the under-parts extended up to include the face and above
the eyes, and that the top of the head, nape and mantle were glossy green
rather than blue as on the Tree Swallows, all leaving no doubt in my mind
that they were both adult males. Both birds remained on the utility lines
during the entire time that we had them under observation, so we did not
see the white on the sides of the rump or the violet coloration on the
tail.
