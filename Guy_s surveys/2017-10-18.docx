      I spent Wednesday, 18 October 2017 (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM) with Curtis A.
Marantz and Eric Sibbald birding a few select locations within the Imperial
Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at
the IID Wetlands near Niland, then drove northward into Niland, where we
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then
south along Luna Avenue. From there we drove southwestward by way of Pound,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst
and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
spending a little time around the refuge HQ buildings and Rock Hill, we
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road. From there we continued southwestward to Unit 1 of
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. We then drove eastward to
Calipatria, stopping to look for land-bird around the intersection of
Sperry and Bowles Roads west of the town. We then drove south into Brawley,
stopping briefly at Ramer Lake. In Brawley, we looked at Riverview
Cemetery. At this time Curtis A. Marantz and Eric Sibbald departed to drive
north. I then looked quickly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue
and at Cattle Call Park. I then continued south by way of Forrester Road to
Sunbeam Lake, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on the way, and ending the day
at Fig Lagoon.
      It was partially cloudy with virtually no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 65 to 100 degrees.
      Land-birds appeared scarcer than they were a week ago, and despite
much looking we found very little of note.

      Curtis A. Marantz and Eric Sibbald stopped at the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ in the late afternoon when on their way north to
Riverside and photographed a “female” Cassin’s Finch. This highly irregular
late fall and winter vagrant to the Salton Sink is known to have reached
the Salton Sink during only five fall/winters, with the most recent in
November 2000. In addition, this sighting establishes the earliest date in
fall for the Salton Sink, the previous earliest date being 2 November 2000
(6-7 in west Niland (4th Street) 2-14 November 2000).
