        22-23 May 2018 - Salton Sea/Imperial Valley, Imperial County.


      I spent part of Tuesday, 22 May 2018 and all of Wednesday 23 May with
Jeff Shenot, a visiting birder from Maryland, at select locations in the
Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea.

      On Tuesday, 22 May 2018 (NOON-7:00 PM), we started at Fig Lagoon and
Lakeview Golfcourse, then drove east to the southeastern corner of El
Centro. From there we drove north through Brawley and Calipatria to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ by way of Dogwood Road, Highway 111
and Sinclair Road, stopping at the algae plant on Hoober Road on the way.
After looking for birds around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ
and the area around Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the shore
of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte,
and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road (very few birds along
this stretch of the shore). We then drove southeastward into Brawley and
concluded the day at Cattle Call Park.
      There were no clouds, no wind with temperatures between 75 and 90
degrees.

      As we turned from Gentry Road onto McKendry Road, a short distance
south of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, I was attracted to a
large dark swallow perched on the utility lines. Upon stopping and looking
at it with the aid of binoculars through the front windshield, I saw that
it was an adult male Purple Martin. The bird quickly flew but remained in
sight as it foraged over the field separating McKendry Road and the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, crossing over McKendry Road on a couple of
occasions. When the bird was in flight, I was able to see that it was a
large Swallow with forked tail similar to that of a Tree Swallow. Although
the bird appeared entirely black, with the aid of my binoculars I was able
to see that it was in fact dark blue. Jeff xx obtained photos of the bird
in flight.
      The Purple Martin is now a casual spring migrant to the Salton Sink,
with an average of one recorded every two or three years in the past 15
years. It has been recorded as early as 23 March (one Unit 1 of Salton Sea
NWR in 2016) and 10 April (one at west end of Bowles Road in 2013) to as
late as 23 May (one at Mecca in 1999) and 28 May (one at Finney Lake in
2010).
