      I spent Sunday, 13 May 2018 (5:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam Lake, then drove northward
to the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of
Brawley, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way. I then drove
northward into Brawley where I quickly looked in Riverview Cemetery. From
there I continued northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland, then on
northward into Niland. In Niland I birded northward along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there I
drove northwestward by way of English Road, Highway 111 and Beach Road to
the Wister Unit HQ. From there I drove south through the Wister Unit on
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, stopping to look at the west end of
Beach Road and the area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. I
then drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the
Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road (very
few birds along this stretch of the shore), and southwestward to Unit 1 of
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. I
then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, then southward
by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Fig Lagoon.
      It was clear with wind in the morning becoming a breeze by late
afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 60 to 90 degrees.
