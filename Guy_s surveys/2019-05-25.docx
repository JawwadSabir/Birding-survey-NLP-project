      I spent Saturday 25 May 2019 (6:00 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping at the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. From Brawley I drove northward
through Calipatria to Niland, stopping at, the Earthrise Nutritionales
Facility and the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott, English and Highway 111
to the Wister Unit HQ. After spending time there, I drove south on Davis
Road to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, stopping
to look at the waterbirds at the shallow water impoundments south of Beach
Road. I then drove southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay,
then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge
HQ buildings and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I checked for
water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of
Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end
of Young Road. From there I drove southward through Westmorland into
Brawley. In Brawley I looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery and at Cattle
Call Park. I then drove south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast
corner of El Centro. After spending time near the southeast corner of El
Centro, I drove westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.

ranging from 60 to 85 degrees.
