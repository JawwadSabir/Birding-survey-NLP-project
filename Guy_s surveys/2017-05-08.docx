      I spent Sunday, 8 May 2017 (5:30 AM to 5:00 PM), with Curtis A.
Marantz, Howard B. King and Peter A. Gaede birding a few select locations
within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. We
started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
spending some time at each location, then drove east to a location near the
southeastern corner of El Centro. After spending much time in El Centro, we
drove north through Brawley and Calipatria, then west on Sinclair Roads to
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. We then checked for water birds
around Rock Hill, along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton
Sea to the west end of Young Road. We then drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley where CAM, HBK and PAG departed to the north, and
I drove south, stopping to look at Fig Lagoon before heading west to San
Diego.
      There were scattered high clouds throughout the day, increasing in the
afternoon, with rain-showers moving into the area during the latter half of
the afternoon (I was driving through light rain by the time I reached
Ocotillo Wells), with light to moderate wind most of the day, and with
temperatures ranging from 55 to 70 degrees.
