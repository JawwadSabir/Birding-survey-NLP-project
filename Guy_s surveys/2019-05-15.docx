      I spent Wednesday 15 May 2019 (5:30 AM to 6:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping at the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. From Brawley I drove northward
through Calipatria to Niland, stopping at the Earthrise Nutritionales
Facility and the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott, English and Highway 111
to the Wister Unit HQ. After spending a little time there, I drove south on
Davis Road to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads,
stopping to look at the waterbirds at the shallow water impoundment south
of Beach Road. I then drove southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to
Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road, then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From Unit 1 I drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I looked for birds in Riverview
Cemetery. I then drove south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast
corner of El Centro. After spending time near the southeast corner of El
Centro, I drove westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      High overcast throughout the day with very light to no wind until the
late afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 65 to 95 degrees.
      Waterfowl numbers decreasing and shorebirds mostly departed. Few
migrant land-birds.

      The single (1) Rose-breasted Grosbeak was well seen feeding on
mulberries at the west end of 4th Street in Niland. This was an obvious
female Rose-breasted/Black-headed Grosbeak. However, the under-parts were
mostly whitish, lacking the orangish coloration present on a female Black-
headed Grosbeak in the same tree, with blackish streaks on the breast,
sides, flanks and belly. In addition the head-pattern was more striking
than that on the female Black-headed Grosbeak, the cheek-patch looking
darker and the supercilium being striking white. The bill, including the
upper mandible, was pale, unlike the two-tone colored bill on the Black-
headed Grosbeak.
