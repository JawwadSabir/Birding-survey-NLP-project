      I spent most of Wednesday, 7 November 2018 (6:00 AM to 4:30 PM), with
Lars Jonsson and his wife visitors from Sweden, checking a few locations in
the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started
the day at Ramer Lake where viewing was limited by ground fog. From Rammer
Lake we drove northward to the area west of Calipatria, stopping to look at
Young Reservoir on the way. From there we continued northward to Morton Bay
by way of English and Schrimpf Roads, stopping to look for gulls near the
intersection of Davis and Schrimpf Roads. From there we drove southwestward
by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and
looking at Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and
between Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. We then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
there we drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. After
leaving Lars Jonsson and his wife at their vehicle for an early return
drive to Los Angeles, I looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue, spent a little time at Cattle Call Park, and looked briefly at
Jeffrey Thomas Park. I then drove south on Forrester Road, stopping to look
at Sheldon Reservoir, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      The sky was clear, but with ground fog in the early morning, little to
no wind throughout the day, and with temperatures ranging from 60 to 85
degrees.
      Thousands of unidentified waterfowl and gulls were congregated on the
open water off the mouths of the Alamo and New Rivers, presumably resting
for the day.
