      I spent Wednesday 7 August 2019 (5:45 AM to 5:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward through Brawley to
Ramer Lake (south section mostly dry with few birds). From Ramer Lake I
continued northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands, spending some
time around the northeast corner of the Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands I
continued north into Niland. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and
Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. From there I drove south on Davis Road
to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then
southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay I
drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I spent a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill. I then checked
for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of
Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte (large number of gulls – most being Ring-
billed Gulls), and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I
then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge, spending time there sorting through shorebirds. From Unit 1 I drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I quickly looked
for birds in Riverview Cemetery. I then drove south to the southeast corner
of El Centro, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Overcast most of the day, with little to no wind and very light rain
in the early afternoon. Temperatures ranged from 85 to 105 degrees.
