      I spent Wednesday, 19 April 2017 (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north into Brawley, stopping along the way briefly
at Sheldon Reservoir and for much longer in the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. In Brawley I looked briefly at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, then spent a little more time in
Cattle Call Park. I then drove north to Niland, stopping at the east end of
Date Street in Calipatria and at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands
on the way. In Niland I birded quickly northward along International
Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna
Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound and Davis Roads to
the southwestern corner of the Wister Unit. From here I drove south along
Davis Road and west along Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay, then south on Garst
and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ
and Rock Hill. I then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte and, from Obsidian Butte along
the south shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending a
little time in the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads,
the west end of Young Road, at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and at Carter Reservoir. I then drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley and south on Dogwood Road to near the southeastern
corner of El Centro. After spending time in El Centro, I drove west, and
looked at Fig Lagoon before heading west to San Diego.
      It was mostly clear throughout the day, with some wind in the morning,
and with temperatures ranging from 65 to 95 degrees.
      Numbers of ducks have continued to decline as these birds depart for
breeding grounds to the north, and the number and variety of shorebirds was
noticeably less than on 14 April. Migrant land-birds were still present in
small numbers, but the variety was much reduced.
