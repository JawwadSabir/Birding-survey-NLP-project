      After learning that a Brown Thrasher arrived at private property near
the southeast corner of El Centro on 27 December, I chose to look for the
bird myself on 29 December 2016. I arrived at Fig Lagoon at dawn to find
hunters present, so quickly departed and stopped at nearby Sunbeam Lake.
From here I went to the southeast corner of El Centro, but failed to see
the thrasher in over one hour of looking. I then drove north through
Brawley and Westmorland, and looked along the shore of the Salton Sea
between the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads and Obsidian Butte, then
spent time around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill.
As I was departing this area, I received a call advising me that the Brown
Thrasher was present, so I returned to the southeast corner of El Centro
where I remained until 3:30 PM. There was much cloud-cover, but virtually
no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 40 to 65 degrees.
      Heavy rain earlier in the week left most dirt roads with standing
water and muddy, therefore not drivable. Since I spent much time at one
location near El Centro, I made no attempt to estimate numbers of
individuals for most species.
