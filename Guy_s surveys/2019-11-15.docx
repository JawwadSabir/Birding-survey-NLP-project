      I spent Friday 15 November 2019 (5:45 AM to 4:30 PM) Maria H. Cordoba
and Paul Fox checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the
south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon and nearby
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north into Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir
and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way.
In Brawley we looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and
Cattle Call Park. We then continued north to Calipatria, stopping at Wiest
Lake, the area around the entrance to Ramer Lake and Young Reservoir, In
Calipatria we limited our birding to the areas around the intersection of
Sperry and Eddins Roads west of the center of town. From Calipatria we
drove northwestward to the north end of Garst Road on Morton Bay by way of
English and Schrimpf Roads. From here we drove southwestward by way of
Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and
spent time around the Refuge HQ buildings. We then looked at the ponds
adjacent to Rock Hill and along the shore towards the west end of Sinclair
Road. From there we checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton
Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road from Obsidian Butte, and the
shoreline of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young
Road. We then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge From there we looked at Carter Reservoir and headed south
to Interstate Highway 8 by way of Westmorland and Forrester Road, making
our final stop at Sheldon Reservoir.
