      I spent Friday 20 September 2019 (6:15 AM to 6:00 PM) with Nathan
French checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south
shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Ramer Lake looking through
the large number of herons and ibis. From Ramer Lake we drove northward
through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands, spending some time around the
northeast corner of the Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands we continued north
into Niland. In Niland we birded northward along International Avenue, west
along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there we drove
northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and Highway 111 to the
Wister Unit HQ. From there we drove south on Davis Road to the wet area at
the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then southwestward on Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay we drove southwestward by way
of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ.
We spent a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings, then looked at the
ponds adjacent to Rock Hill and along the shore towards the west end of
Sinclair Road. We then checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and
from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. We then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
Unit 1 we drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at
an area of shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86.
In Brawley we only looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery. We then drove
south to near the southeast corner of El Centro, and ended the day looking
at Sunbeam Lake at Fig Lagoon.
      Clear sky with virtually no wind and temperatures ranged from 65 to
95 degrees.
