I spent Thursday, 28 September 2017 (6:30 AM to 6:00 PM) with Bill Tweit (from Washington) and Curtis A. Marantz birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Ramer Lake, then drove north to the IID Wetlands near Niland, stopping along the way at an irrigated field at the intersection of Hoober Road and Highway 111. From there we drove northward into Niland, where we birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue. From there we drove southwestward by way of Noffsinger, English, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the refuge HQ buildings and Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. We then continued southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From there we drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley, we looked at Riverview Cemetery, then quickly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call Park. Bill Tweit and I (CAM departed to drive north) then continued south by way of Forrester Road to bird around Sunbeam Lake, then somewhat briefly at Lakeview Golfcourse, and ending the day at Fig Lagoon before heading west to San Diego.
 	It was clear with no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 60 to 100 degrees.

	The single (1) immature Roseate Spoonbill at Fig Lagoon was standing in shallow water with a few White Pelicans, Snowy Egrets, American Avocets and a White-faced Ibis near the southeast corner of the lake. It was noticeably larger than the Snowy Egrets and White-faced Ibis, but obviously smaller than the White Pelicans. The bird was mostly white, with the mantle and wings pale pink. The spatulated bill appeared pale pinkish merging into the pale blue unfeathered skin at the face, and the eyes were dark. The upper parts of the legs were pale reddish (lower parts of the legs and feet were in the water so not visible). When this bird spread its wings I was able to see that the entire upper-parts of the wings were pale pink, but with terminal part of the outer-web of the outer three or four primaries black. We made no attempt to make this bird fly, so it was still standing at the same place when we left at 6:00 PM.
	Roseate Spoonbills are irregular summer and fall vagrants from the south, occasionally in fair numbers, with over 50 at the Salton Sink in 1973. However, the number of birds getting to the Salton Sink, and the frequency of occurrences have both declined in the past thirty years, with the most recent being an immature at Morton Bay 10 January to 21 March 2015.
