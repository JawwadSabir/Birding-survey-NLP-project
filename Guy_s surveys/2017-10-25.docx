      I spent Wednesday, 25 October 2017 (6:45 AM to 5:00 PM) birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of
the Salton Sea. I started the day at Sheldon Reservoir, then moved
northward to the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads
southwest of Brawley. I then drove northeastward into Brawley where I
looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, then spent a little
time in Cattle Call Park and at Riverview Cemetery. From Brawley I drove
northward to the IID Wetlands near Niland, stopping to look at a few
locations west of Calipatria. I then drove northward into Niland, where I
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then
south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove southwestward by way of Pound,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst
and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
spending a little time around the refuge HQ buildings (I foolishly left my
binoculars here), I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton
Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from
Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. From there I continued
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
there I drove eastward to Westmorland, then south to Fig Lagoon, stopping
to look at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way.
      It was clear with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranging
from 60 to 95 degrees.
      I managed to see an impressive variety of waterfowl, especially on
Sheldon Reservoir, and confirmed the fact that the movement of Cassin’s
Finches and Pine Siskins into California’s lowlands this fall has reached
the Imperial Valley.
