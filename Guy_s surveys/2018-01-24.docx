      I spent Wednesday, 24 January 2018 (6:45 AM to 4:45 PM) birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of
the Salton Sea. I started the day in Brawley where I looked briefly at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spent some time in Cattle Call
Park. From Brawley I drove northward to the IID Wetlands near Niland,
stopping at Young Reservoir southeast of Calipatria, and at the Earthrise
Nutritionales Facility north of Calipatria on the way. At the IID Wetlands
I spent time looking for land-birds in the riparian growth at the northeast
corner of the Wetlands and a short time elsewhere. I then continued
northward into Niland, where I birded northward along International Avenue,
west along 4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove
southwestward by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton
Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the
Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. From
there I continued southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge, Carter Reservoir and the north end of Poe Road. I then
drove southeastward to Westmorland, then south on Forrester Road to Fig
Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way.
      The sky was clear, with virtually no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 40 to 70 degrees.
      It was interesting to note that the Snow and Ross’s Geese at Unit 1
of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge remained apart, with the Ross’s
Geese adjacent to Vendel Road just to the south of the viewing tower, and
the Snow Geese farther south. Large numbers of shorebirds were on the shore
west of the north end of Poe Road, but I didn’t have the time to walk
closer to them, so was only able to identify those closest to me.
