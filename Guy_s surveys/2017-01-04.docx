      On Wednesday, 4 January 2017, we (Justyn T. Stahl and Nicol Desnoyers)
stopped at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge at about 7:00
AM when on our way to the north end of the Salton Sea to look for a Black-
headed Gull found at Oasis on 30 December. After spending time with the
Black-headed Gull, we returned to the south end of the Salton Sea by way of
Highway 111 along the east side of the Salton Sea. At the south end of the
Salton Sea, we stopped briefly in Niland, looked for land-birds in the
willows at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands, spent time at the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, then looked along the shore of the
Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the intersection of Lack and Lindsey
Roads. From here we drove south through Westmorland, stopping at Sheldon
Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before heading
west towards San Diego at about 4:30 PM. There was some wispy cloud-cover,
virtually no wind, and temperatures ranging from 45 to 65 degrees.
      Recent heavy rain has left most dirt roads with standing water and
muddy, therefore not drivable. Since stops were limited with most being
somewhat brief, I made no attempt to estimate numbers of individuals for
most species.
