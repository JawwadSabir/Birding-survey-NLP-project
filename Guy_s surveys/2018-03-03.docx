         3 March 2018 - Salton Sea/Imperial Valley, Imperial County.

      I spent part of Saturday, 3 March 2018 (6:15 AM to 2:00 PM), first
(6:15 AM- 11:00 AM with a quick break to look at the north end of Poe Road)
looking for what I suspect was a Sharp-tailed Sandpiper photographed by
Becky Turley at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge on 27
February 2018. I then, after the arrival of a wind-storm, (11:00 AM to 2:00
PM) looked at some of the Imperial Irrigation District reservoirs (Carter,
Young and Sheldon) for waterfowl and swallows, and ended the day at Sunbeam
Lake and Fig Lagoon.
      It was partially cloudy, with little to no wind up to about 10:45,
then with strong winds and blowing dust from the west after 11:00 AM, and
with temperatures ranging from 45 to 75 degrees.
