      I spent Friday 14 June 2019 (5:30 AM to 5:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping at the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. From Brawley I drove northward
through Calipatria to Niland, stopping at the Earthrise Nutritionales
Facility and the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott, English and Highway 111
to the Wister Unit HQ. I then drove south on Davis Road to the wet area at
the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, stopping to look at the
waterbirds at a shallow water impoundments near the southwest corner of the
Wister Unit. I then drove southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to
Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge, and looked at the north end of Poe Road
(virtually no birds). From there I drove southward through Westmorland into
Brawley. In Brawley I looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery and at Cattle
Call Park. I then drove south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast
corner of El Centro, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Clear with no wind until about 4:00 PM when a strong wind from the
west hit, and temperatures ranging from 75 to 105 degrees.
