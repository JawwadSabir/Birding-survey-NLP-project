      I spent Wednesday, 20 June 2018 (5:15 AM to 5:15 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley. I then drove northward into Brawley where
I quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. From there I
continued northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland, stopping to look
at the algae plant on Hoober Road on the way. I then continued northward
into Niland where I birded northward along International Avenue, west along
4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove northwestward
by way of English Road, Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. From there I
drove south through the Wister Unit on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton
Bay, stopping to look at the area at the intersection of Pound and Davis
Roads. I then drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road (very
few birds along this stretch of the shore), and southwestward to Unit 1 of
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. I
then drove southeastward through Westmorland to Ramer Lake. I then drove
south into Brawley where I looked at Riverview Cemetery and Cattle Call
Park. I then drove southward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam
Lake, Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon.
      It was clear with no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 75 to
110 degrees.
      Large numbers of Long-billed Curlews and Willets were in evidence and
the first of the southbound Wilson’s Phalaropes were present.
