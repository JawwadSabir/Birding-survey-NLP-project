      I spent Thursday, 6 October 2016 (6:30 AM-5:30 PM) with Curtis A.
Marantz in the Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I met Curtis in Brawley at 6:15 AM and drove north to IID
Wetlands near Niland, stopping at the algae farm south of Sinclair Road on
the way. We then continued northward into Niland where we birded north
along International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. We then drove westward by way of Alcott,
Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked
for birds on Morton Bay. We then moved southwestward to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along the
shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte. From here we
checked the shore of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the north end of
Poe Road, spending time in the area around the intersection of Lack and
Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge. We then drove southeastward through Westmorland
into Brawley where we separated. I then looked briefly at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call Park. I then proceeded
southward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake, then looked
briefly Lakeview Golf Course, and ended the day at and Fig Lagoon. It was
clear with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 60 to 90
degrees.
      Migrant land-birds were virtually nonexistent, and we failed to
encounter any irrigated fields attracting gulls and shorebirds.
