      I spent Sunday, 28 February 2016 (6:30 AM to 3:30 PM), at and around
the south end of the Salton Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and
Sunbeam Lake then drove northward to Brawley, quick stops at Sheldon
Reservoir and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads.
In Brawley I checked the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and looked
around Cattle Call Park.. I then drove north through Calipatria into
Niland. In Niland I looked for land birds along International Avenue, then
westward along 4th Street and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove
westward by way of Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of
Garst Road. From here I drove southward the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ. From here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea southwestward from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road,
stopping in the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. I
then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge. From here I drove southward into Westmorland, then on south to
Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake and Fig Lagoon. The sky was clear in the
morning, but with high overcast in the afternoon, there was little to no
wind, and temperatures ranging from 55 to 85 degrees.
