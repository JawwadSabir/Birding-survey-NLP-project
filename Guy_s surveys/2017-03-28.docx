      I spent Tuesday, 29 March 2017 (6:45 AM to 4:45 PM), birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley. I started the day looking at
Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake, then drove north towards
Calipatria and the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I then spent
nearly two hours at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ looking
unsuccessfully for a Eurasian Green-winged Teal reported here by Ed Stonick
on 26 March. I then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along
the south shore of the Salton Sea to the west end of Young Road, spending a
little time in the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads.
I then returned to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and spent an
additional hour looking at teal, this time seeing what I believe was the
Eurasian Green-winged Teal reported by Ed Stonick. From here I drove south
into Westmorland, then southeastward into Brawley. In Brawley I stopping
briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, then looked around
part of southwestern Brawley and Cattle Call Park. I then drove south along
Dogwood Road to the southeast corner of El Centro. After spending time near
the southeast corner of El Centro, I headed west, stopping at Fig Lagoon
before heading west towards San Diego. There was mostly clear, with minimal
wind, and with temperatures ranging from 50 to 90 degrees.

The single (1) American x Eurasian Green-winged Teal hybrid was an adult
male with Green-winged Teal at the waterfowl ponds at the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ. This duck was the same size and shape as
nearby Green-winged Teal, and similar in coloration and pattern, but it had
a prominent horizontal white stripe separating the mantle from the flanks
as would be expected on a Eurasian Green-winged Teal. However, upon closer
investigation, I noted that there was a vertical white bar separating the
breast from the flanks, this bar being less prominent than that on the
nearby male Green-winged Teal, and not even noticeable when the duck was
swimming at an angle away from me. In addition, the pattern on the head of
this duck appeared to match that of the nearby male Green-winged Teal, and
lacked the obvious pale stripes framing the green on the face and extending
downward from above the eyes to the gape normally present on Eurasian Green-
winged Teal.
