       I spent Friday, 8 February 2019 (6:15 AM to 4:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Sheldon Reservoir, then moved northward into
Brawley, stopping in the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley on the way. In Brawley I stopped at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, and spent some time in Cattle Call
Park. From Brawley I drove northwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge, spending some time around the viewing platform. I
then moved westward to the north end of Poe Road where large numbers of
shorebirds were visible along the shore. From Poe Road I drove
northeastward to the northeast edge of the New River and worked my way
northeastward along the shore of the Salton Sea to Obsidian Butte. I then
looked for birds around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and at
Rock Hill. From there I continued northeastward to the intersection of
Pound and Davis Roads by way of Sinclair, Garst and Schrimpf Roads. I then
drove eastward on Pound Road (muddy) to Highway 111 and looked at the
riparian growth at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands (no wood-
warblers). I then drove south, jogging east to look at the area around the
Calipatria State Prison, then southwestward to the area immediately west of
Calipatria. From there I drove to Young Reservoir and on south to Ramer
Lake (access limited due to muddy roads). I then continued southward
through Brawley to the southeast corner of El Centro, and ended the day at
Fig Lagoon.
      Mostly clear sky with no wind throughout the day, and with
temperatures ranging from 35 to 65 degrees.
