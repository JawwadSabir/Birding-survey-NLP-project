      I spent most of Wednesday, 20 July 2016 (5:45 AM-4:00 PM), in the
Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I
started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley, then proceeded northward to Ramer Lake,
spending a short time there, then on northward through Calipatria to
Niland. In Niland I birded north along International Avenue, then westward
along 4th Street and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by
way of Pound, Davis Roads and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road
and checked for birds on Morton Bay. I then moved southward to the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. From here I checked for
water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte
southwestward to the west end of Young Road, stopping in the areas around
Obsidian Butte and the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. I then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the
north end of Poe Road. From there I drove south eastward through
Westmorland into Brawley, spending a little time in the southwest portion
of Brawley. I then proceeded southward along Dogwood Road to southeastern
El Centro. From there I drove west, stopping briefly at Lakeview Golf
Course and Fig Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley. It was clear,
with very little wind, and with temperatures ranging from 80 to 110
degrees.
      I spent much time looking unsuccessfully for juvenile Least and
Western Sandpipers – I suspect few, if any have reached the Salton Sink as
of this date.
