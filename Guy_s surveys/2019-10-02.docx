      I spent Wednesday 2 October 2019 (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started at the IID Wetlands, spending some time around the northeast
corner of the Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands I drove north into Niland
(Highway 111 was closed at the northern edge of Niland preventing me from
going to the Niland Boat Landing as planned). In Niland I birded northward
along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna
Avenue. From there I drove westward by way of Alcott, English and Pound
Roads to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then
southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay I
drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ and spent time around the Refuge HQ buildings.
I then looked at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill and along the shore
towards the west end of Sinclair Road. From there I checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I
then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge (the bridges at both Lack and Gentry Roads closed). From Unit 1 I
drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at an area
of shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86. In
Brawley I looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call Park. I then drove southward
by way Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro, detouring
west to Sheldon Reservoir on the way. I then ended the day at Sunbeam Lake
and Fig Lagoon.
      Clear sky with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranged from
50 to 90 degrees.
      The rain on 25 September left some roads unsafe to drive. As such I
was unable to access some locations, especially so at Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge.

      The single (1) American Golden-Plover was on the exposed mudflats
immediately west of Rock Hill. The fact that this plover was noticeably
smaller than a nearby Black-bellied Plover, showed a prominent white
supercilium, and appeared long legged, attracted my attention. After a
short time studying the bird, and noting the fact that the black primaries
extended well past the longest tertials, it flew a short distance when
harassed by a Black-bellied Plover. At that time I was able to see that the
upperparts were uniform in color other than the presence of a faint wing-
stripe, and that the under-sides of the wings were gray.
      The American Golden-Plover is a rare fall migrant at the Salton Sink,
with virtually all being juveniles recorded in October and November, with
normally no more than one or two a year.
