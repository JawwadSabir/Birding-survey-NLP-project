      I spent Friday 6 December 2019 (6:30 AM to 3:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. Recent heavy rain left most unpaved roads impassable, limiting where I
could drive. I started the day at the IID Wetlands south of Niland where I
was only able to check the riparian growth at the northeast corner. I then
drove north into Niland. In Niland I birded north along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From Niland I
drove south into Calipatria, then wound my way northwestward by Eddins,
English and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I
spent time around the Refuge HQ buildings looking for a Rose-breasted
Grosbeak photographed here on 1 December, then looked at the ponds adjacent
to Rock Hill and along the shore towards the west end of Sinclair Road
(gravel road drivable). I was unable to drive to the viewing spots on
Obsidian Butte (muddy). I then checked the shoreline of the Salton Sea from
Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge (gravel entry road
drivable). From Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge I headed
southeast through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I looked at
Riverview Cemetery (no birds), the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue
and for landbirds in Cattle Call Park (very few birds). I then drove
southward to Interstate Highway 8 by way of Forrester Road, making my final
stops at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake and Fig Lagoon.

ranging from 50 to 70 degrees.
