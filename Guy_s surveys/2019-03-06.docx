       I spent Wednesday 6 March 2019 (5:45 AM to 3:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Sheldon Reservoir, then moved northward through
Westmorland to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. After
spending time there I drove northeastward to the west end of Young Road and
worked my way northeastward along the shore of the Salton Sea to Obsidian
Butte. I then looked for birds around the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ and at Rock Hill. From there I continued northeastward to the
intersection of Pound and Davis Roads by way of Sinclair, Garst and
Schrimpf Roads. I then drove eastward on McDonald Road to the IID Wetlands
and into Niland. In Niland I quickly I birded northward along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From Niland I
drove south to Calipatria, jogging east to look at the area around the
Calipatria State Prison, and southwestward to the area immediately west of
Calipatria. From there I drove to Wiest Lake and continued southward into
Brawley. In Brawley drove around Riverview Cemetery stopped at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, and quickly looked at Cattle Call
Park (3 school busses with students present). From Brawley. I then moved
southwestward, stopping briefly in the area around the intersection of
Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam
Lake and Lakeview Golfcourse, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Broken cloud-cover throughout the day with strong wind in the
afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees.
      Most of the geese and all of the cranes appeared to have departed.
Water level at the viewing platform in Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge dropping resulting in an increase in shorebird numbers,
particularly Long-billed Dowitchers, Stilt Sandpipers and Least Sandpipers
along with the addition of Dunlin and Western Sandpipers. Obvious decrease
in the number of gulls along the shore of the Salton Sea. Passerines in low
numbers, but strong winds in the afternoon made viewing conditions for
birding difficult at best.
