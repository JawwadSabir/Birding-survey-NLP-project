      I spent Thursday, 20 October 2016 (7:00 AM-5:30 PM) with Susan E.
Smith, Janis Cadwallader and Pat Bacchetti in the Imperial Valley and along
part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Ramer
Lake, then continued northward to the IID Wetlands near Niland, and on
northward into Niland. In Niland we birded north along International
Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna
Avenue. We then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf
Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for birds on Morton Bay.
We then moved southwestward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ,
and checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock
Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along the shore of the
Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending time in the area around
the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young Road, and
at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. We then drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley we looked
briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call
Park. We then proceeded southward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to
Sunbeam Lake, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on the way, then looked briefly
Lakeview Golf Course, and ended the day at and Fig Lagoon. It was clear
with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 65 to 95
degrees.
