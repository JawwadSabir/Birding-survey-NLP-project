	On Sunday, 11 October 2017, after learning that Jeremiah Stock had seen an Ovenbird and three species of noteworthy sparrows at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ on 14 October, I chose to spend the afternoon there looking for these birds. I arrived at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ at 1:00 PM and remained there until 5:00 PM, looking through the sparrows. I also looked through the waterbirds attracted to the field immediately east of the HQ’s which was being irrigated, and spent about 45 minutes looking through the waterbirds gathered along the shore of the Salton Sea off the west end of Sinclair Road.
	The sky was clear, there was no wind and the temperature remained around 90 degrees.
	Species seen and/or heard –Blue-winged Teal (2 – two together at the west end of Sinclair Road), Northern Shoveler (300), American Wigeon (10), Mallard (10), Northern Pintail (5), Green-winged Teal (5), Redhead (15), Lesser Scaup (2), Ruddy Duck (200), Gambel’s Quail (15), Western Grebe (3), Eurasian Collared-Dove (30), Common Ground-Dove (10), Mourning Dove (15), Greater Roadrunner (1), Virginia Rail (1), Sora (6), American Coot (30), Black-necked Stilt (10), American Avocet (30), Black-bellied Plover (20), Killdeer (10), Long-billed Curlew (75), Marbled Godwit (10), Dunlin (2), Least Sandpiper (100), Western Sandpiper (150), Long-billed Dowitcher (200), Lesser Yellowlegs (1), Willet (10), Greater Yellowlegs (5), Ring-billed Gull (500), Yellow-footed Gull (1), California Gull (5), Herring Gull (35), Lesser Black-backed Gull (1 – adult at the west end of Sinclair Road appeared to be the same bird as seen near here on 6 October. Today I noted small white tips on the primaries indicating this gull was an adult despite the black on the bill), Caspian Tern (2), Forster’s Tern (3), Black Skimmer (2 – two adults at the west end of Sinclair Road), Double-crested Cormorant (15), American White Pelican (150), Brown Pelican (5), Least Bittern (1), Great Blue Heron (3), Great Egret (15), Snowy Egret (10), Cattle Egret (50), Black-crowned Night-Heron (1), White-faced Ibis (30), Cooper’s Hawk (2), Red-tailed Hawk (1), Burrowing Owl (1), Northern (Red-shafted) Flicker (1), American Kestrel (3), Black Phoebe (6), Say’s Phoebe (2), Tree Swallow (5), Barn Swallow (100), Verdin (2), House Wren (1), Marsh Wren (5), House Sparrow (6), House Finch (2), Abert’s Towhee (6), Savannah Sparrow (2), Fox Sparrow (2 – two Passerella iliaca altivagans seen together on one occasion, one having a bit more gray about the head than did the other, were no doubt the same two “Sooty Fox Sparrows” reported present on 14 October by Jeremiah Stock), Song Sparrow (3), White-crowned Sparrow (25), Golden-crowned Sparrow (1 – one first-winter plumage bird well studied as it fed on the ground with White-crowned Sparrows was no doubt the same “first-winter” bird reported present on 14 October by Jeremiah Stock), Western Meadowlark (3), Red-winged Blackbird (20), Brown-headed Cowbird (2), Ovenbird (1 – one well seen on multiple occasions as it walked about in the open in the jerking manner, typical for this species, gleaning small insects from the ground was no doubt the same Ovenbird reported present on 14 October by Jeremiah Stock. I noted the uniform greenish-olive upper-parts, gleaming white under-parts with well-defined streaks across the breast and along the flanks, the conspicuous white eye-rings, and the orange muted olive central crown-stripe bordered by blackish lateral crown-stripes. One collected near the south shore of the Salton Sea on 3 October 1948 (SBCM 37593) is the only other record at the Salton Sink in fall, but there are five records in May, one in early June, and two more in mid-winter), Orange-crowned Warbler (3), Common Yellowthroat (1) and Yellow-rumped Warbler (15) – 76 species.
	Despite spending much time looking through the sparrows at the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge for the White-throated Sparrow reported present on 14 October by Jeremiah Stock, and managing to see each of the other noteworthy birds on multiple occasions, I was unable to find this sparrow, and assume that it was no longer present.
