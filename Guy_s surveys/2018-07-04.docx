      I spent Wednesday, 4 July 2018 (5:15 AM to 5:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley where I
quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at the
adjacent residential areas. I then drove north to Ramer Lake, stopping at
Riverview Cemetery as I left Brawley. From Ramer Lake I continued northward
to the IID Wetlands south of Niland, stopping to look at the algae plant on
Hoober Road on the way. I then continued northward into Niland where I
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and
south along Luna Avenue. I then drove northwestward by way of Alcott and
English Roads and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. After birding around
the HQ I drove south through the Wister Unit on Davis Road and west on
Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay, stopping to look at the wet area at the
intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. I then drove southwestward by way of
Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ.
After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at
Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea
between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian
Butte to the west end of Young Road (very few birds along this stretch of
the shore). I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From there I drove
northeastward back to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge to take a
second look at the birds gathered at the west end of Sinclair Road. I then
then drove east on Sinclair Road, then south through Calipatria and Brawley
and on southward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake and
Lakeview Golfcourse, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way, and
ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      It was mostly clear but with some thin high clouds in the late
morning, with little to no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 75 to
105 degrees.
      There was a substantial increase in the number of Western Sandpipers
during the past five days. Again I was unable to find any irrigated fields
attracting shorebirds and substantial numbers of Ring-billed Gulls.
      Species seen and/or heard – Cinnamon Teal (50), Northern Shoveler (3 –
three apparently healthy “females” feeding on the shore of the Salton Sea
