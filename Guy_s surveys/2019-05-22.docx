      I spent Wednesday 22 May 2019 (5:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping at the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. From Brawley I drove northward
through Calipatria to Niland, stopping at Ramer Lake, the Earthrise
Nutritionales Facility and the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded northward
along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna
Avenue. From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott, English and
Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. After spending a little time there, I
drove south on Davis Road to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and
Davis Roads, stopping to look at the waterbirds at the shallow water
impoundments south of Beach Road. I then drove southwestward on Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the
ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of
the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte,
and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, then I drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
there I drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, then south
along Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro. After
spending time near the southeast corner of El Centro, I drove westward and
ended the day at Fig Lagoon.

      When birding with Curtis A. Marantz near the southeast corner of El
Centro in the afternoon, Curtis heard a short “Solitary Vireo” like song,
and after some looking, found a single (1) Yellow-throated Vireo. The bird
was most cooperative, moving slowly and staying low in the trees, thus
allowing for multiple photographs. This bird was similar in size and shape
as a Cassin’s Vireo. However, the head and mantle were an unmarked
yellowish-green merging into blue-gray on the lower back and rump. The
unmarked tail was darker. The “spectacles” were yellow. The chin, throat
and breast were unmarked yellow, and the rest of the under-parts were clean
white. The wings were dark gray with white fringes on the tertials and less
so on the folded secondaries, and white tips on the median and greater
coverts formed two obvious white wing-bars. The eyes appeared dark, the
bill was blackish, and the legs and feet were blue-gray.
      The single previous record of a Yellow-throated Vireo in Imperial
County was remarkably of a single bird at this same location on 18-19 May
2011 (NAB 65;519).
      As I was sorting through the wood-warblers and other migrants
concentrated in an isolated group of mesquite trees along the eastern edge
of the Lakeview Golfcourse at about 6:30 AM, I noticed a single (1)
Blackpoll Warbler foraging near and on the ground. This obvious wood-
warbler was a little larger than the multiple Yellow Warblers, appeared
plumper, short-necked and had a relatively short tail. This was an entirely
black and white bird. The entire top of the head was unmarked black, the
black extending down to just below the eyes. The face, including the
auriculars and lores, was unmarked gleaming white, bordered below by a
black moustachial stripe. The mantle was gray with black streaks and a
trace of brown. The wings were blackish with white tips on the median and
greater coverts formed two white wing-bars. In addition there were narrow
white fringes on the tertials. The tail was blackish with white tips on the
outer two or three tail-feathers. The under-parts were white with black
streaks on the throat, upper breast, sides and flanks. The eyes were black.
The bill was blackish, and the legs and feet were a bright yellow tinged
orangish.
      This is the first Blackpoll Warbler that I have seen in Imperial
County. There are two previous records for the area around the south end of
the Salton Sea – a male 8 km southwest of Westmorland 18-20 May 1991 (Birds
of the Salton Sea) and a basic-plumage bird in Brawley on 13 September 2008
(NAB 63:159). In addition one was seen in the Lower Colorado River Valley –
a basic-plumage bird near Bard on 10 October 2011 (NAB 66:171).

      The single (1) adult male Rose-breasted Grosbeak was the same size and
shape as nearby Black-headed Grosbeaks, but having a black head and upper-
parts, a white rump, white on the wings and tail, white underparts with a
bright red inverted triangle on the breast, and the same bright red
underwing coverts.
