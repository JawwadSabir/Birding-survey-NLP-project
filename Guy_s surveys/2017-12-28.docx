      I spent Thursday, 28 December 2017 (6:30 AM to 3:30 PM) birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of
the Salton Sea, specifically looking for some of the more noteworthy birds
seen on the 19 December 2017 Salton Sea (south) Christmas Bird Count. I
started the day at Fig Lagoon, then drove northward to the Earthrise
Nutritionales Faciility north of Calipatria, stopping briefly at Sunbeam
Lake, Sheldon Reservoir, the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, and in Brawley. I then continued north to
the IID Wetlands near Niland where I spent time looking for land-birds in
the riparian growth at the northeast corner of the Wetlands. I then
continued northward into Niland, where I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove southwestward by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings, I checked for water
birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair
Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young
Road. From there I drove southward into Westmorland and southeastward into
Brawley. I then drove south on Dogwood Road to Keystone Road, west on
Keystone Road to Forrester Road, then southwestward to Fig Lagoon, stopping
to look at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way.
      It was clear, with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranging
from 45 to 75 degrees.

(50) – 116 species.
      The single (1) Bell’s Vireo responded to my “pissing” when I was in
the riparian growth at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands near
Niland. I noted that this bird was about the size of a nearby Orange-
crowned Warbler, but constantly held its tail upward as is typical for
Bell’s Vireo. The bird was mostly grayish, palest on the under-parts, with
one whitish wing-bar and a somewhat diffused whitish supercilium. However,
there was a trace of greenish on the mantle and a faint trace of yellow on
the flanks. As such, I believe the bird to be the western subspecies
pusillus. This is one of a very few Bell’s Vireos to be found at the Salton
Sink in winter.
