      I spent Thursday, 1 November 2018 (6:45 AM to 5:45 PM), checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, then stopped at Lakeview Golfcourse
and Sunbeam Lake before driving east into El Centro. In El Centro, where I
was joined by Curtis A. Marantz and Eric Sibbald, we spent time looking for
birds in Evergreen Cemetery (remarkably few passerines considering the
habitat). We then drove north into Brawley, where we spent time in
Riverview Cemetery. We then drove northward to Ramer Lake, stopping at
Wiest Lake on our way. From Rammer Lake we drove northward through
Calipatria to the IID Wetlands. After spending time at the northeastern
corner of the IID Wetlands, we proceeded northward into Niland. In Niland
we only birded west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. We then
drove westward by way of Alcott, English, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads
to Morton Bay, stopping to look at the wet area at the intersection of
Pound and Davis Roads, and near the intersection of Davis and Schrimpf
Roads. From there we drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads
to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time
around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, we checked for
water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of
Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and between Obsidian Butte and the west
end of Young Road. We then drove southeastward through Westmorland into
Brawley. After leaving Curtis and Eric to drive north, and I drove south on
Forrester Road, and ended the day looking at Sheldon Reservoir.
      There were some thin high clouds part of the day, little to no wind,
and temperatures ranging from 60 to 85 degrees.
