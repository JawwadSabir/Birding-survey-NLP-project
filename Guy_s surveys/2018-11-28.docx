      I spent Wednesday, 28 November 2018 (6:15 AM to 4:30 PM) with Sara B.
and Keith Mayers checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along
the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon, then
drove northward by way of Forrester and Carter Roads into Brawley, stopping
to look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way. In Brawley we looked briefly at
the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, spent a little time at Cattle
Call Park (remarkably few birds in evidence) and drove slowly through
Riverview Cemetery (virtually no birds in evidence). We then continued
northward to Ramer Lake, stopping at Wiest Lake on the way. From Rammer
Lake we drove northwestward to the area west of Calipatria, stopping to
look at Young Reservoir on the way. We then continued northwestward by way
of English and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. After spending some time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at
Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea
between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and between
Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. We then drove southwestward
to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, spending time there
enjoying the impressive numbers of geese and admiring the cranes. From
there we drove southeastward into Westmorland, then south on Forrester
Road, ending the day looking at Sheldon Reservoir.
      The sky was clear with no wind, and temperatures ranged from 45 to 75
degrees.
