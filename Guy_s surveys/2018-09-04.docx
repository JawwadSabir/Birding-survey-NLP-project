      I spent Tuesday, 4 September 2018 (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley where I
quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then drove
north to Ramer Lake, stopping at Riverview Cemetery as I left Brawley. From
Ramer Lake I continued northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland. I
then continued northward into Niland where I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. I
then drove northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and Highway 111
to the Wister Unit HQ. After birding around the Wister Unit HQ I drove
south through the Wister Unit on Davis Road and west on Schrimpf Road to
Morton Bay, stopping to look at the wet area at the intersection of Pound
and Davis Roads. I then drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair
Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a
little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From there I
drove southeastward through Calipatria and checked for irrigated fields
around the Calipatria State Prison. From there I drove south into Brawley,
then south by way of Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El
Centro. I then drove west to Lakeview Golfcourse and ended the day at Fig
Lagoon.
      The sky was mostly clear with no wind and temperatures ranging from 70
to 100 degrees.
      Although I found 4-5 irrigated fields attracting large numbers of
White-faced Ibis along with Cattle Egrets and Ring-billed Gulls, the only
shorebirds were a handful of Greater and Lesser Yellowlegs – no Baird’s or
other small sandpipers and no Franklin’s Gulls.
