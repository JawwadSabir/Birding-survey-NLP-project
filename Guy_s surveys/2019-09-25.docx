      I spent Wednesday 25 September 2019 (6:15 AM to 5:00 PM) checking a
few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I started at the IID Wetlands, spending some time around the
northeast corner of the Wetlands, but seeing few migrant land-birds. From
the IID Wetlands I drove north into Niland. In Niland I only birded
northward along International Avenue, then, inspired by Scott Surner’s
report of two Parasitic Jaegers at the Niland Boat Landing on 15 September,
drove northward on Highway 111 to the Niland Boat Landing. From there I
drove southward on Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. I spent a short time
there, then continued south on Davis Road to the wet area at the
intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then southwestward on Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay I drove southwestward by way
of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ,
and spent time around the Refuge HQ buildings. I then looked at the ponds
adjacent to Rock Hill and along the shore towards the west end of Sinclair
Road. I then checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea
between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian
Butte to the west end of Young Road. From there I drove southwestward to
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From Unit 1 I drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at an area of
shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86. In Brawley I
looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, at the hummingbird feeders on
Willard Avenue and briefly at Cattle Call Park (rain started as I entered
Cattle Call Park). I then drove southward by way of Carter and Forester
Roads to Fig Lagoon, stopping only at Sheldon Reservoir, and ended the day
at Fig Lagoon.
      Partially cloudy in the morning, with increasing cloud-cover, and
rain starting at about 3:00 PM. Virtually no wind through the morning and
early afternoon, but strong wind associated with the rain, and temperatures
ranged from 65 to 95 degrees.
