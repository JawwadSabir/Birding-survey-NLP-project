      I spent Thursday, 13 October 2016 (7:00 AM-5:00 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Ramer Lake, then continued northward to the IID Wetlands near
Niland, and on northward into Niland. In Niland I birded north along
International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for
birds on Morton Bay. I then moved southwestward to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along
the shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending time in
the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of
Young Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I
then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I
looked briefly at Riverview Cemetery, Pat Williams Park, the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call Park. I then proceeded
southward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake, stopping at
Sheldon Reservoir on the way, then looked briefly Lakeview Golf Course, and
ended the day at and Fig Lagoon. It was mostly clear with virtually no
wind, and with temperatures ranging from 65 to 95 degrees.
