      We (Therese R. Clawson) spent Saturday, 10 September 2016 (6:15 AM-
5:30 PM) with Shawneen Finnegan of Oregon in the Imperial Valley and along
part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Ramer
Lake, then moved northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands near
Niland, stopping at the algae farm south of Sinclair Road on the way. We
then went northward into Niland where we birded north along International
Avenue, then west along the western part of 4th Street, and southward along
Luna Avenue. We then drove westward by way of Noffsinger, Pound, Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road, and checked for birds around
Morton Bay. We then moved southwestward to look for land-birds around the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along
the shoreline of the Salton Sea in the area between Rock Hill and Obsidian
Butte. From here looked along the south shore of the Salton Sea from
Obsidian Butte to the north end of Poe Road, spending time around the
intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young Road, and at
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. We then drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, spending some time at
Cattle Call Park and elsewhere in the southwest portion of Brawley. From
here we proceeded southward by way of Dogwood Road to the southeast corner
of El Centro. We ended the day stopping at Lakeview Golf Course and Fig
Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley and heading west to San Diego. It
was mostly clear with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranging from
75 to 110 degrees.
