      I spent most of Sunday, 2 April 2017 (9:00 AM to 7:00 PM), birding a
few select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day quickly looking at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview
Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake, then drove north through Westmorland to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I then spent over an hour at the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ successfully looking for a Eurasian
Green-winged Teal found here by Ed Stonick on 26 March and confirmed still
present by Kimball L. Garrett on 1 April. I then quickly checked for water
birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to
the west end of Lindsey Road. Upon returning to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ, I received a call from Rosie and Chris Howard, a couple
from Bishop that I had planned to meet, informing me that that they were at
the Wister Unit HQ. We meet in Calipatria at about 1:00 PM and, after
leaving their vehicle in Brawley, we returned to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ, spending much time there enjoying the birdlife. We then
birded southwestward along the shore of the Salton Sea to the west end of
Young Road. From there we drove southeastward through Calipatria to Ramer
Lake, and ended the day in the southwestern part of Brawley.
      It was mostly clear, with minimal to no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 60 to 95 degrees.

      The single (1) Eurasian Green-winged Teal was an adult male seen at
mid-morning with about fifteen (15) American Green-winged Teal, including
the American x Eurasian Green-winged Teal hybrid that I saw on 29 March, on
the Salton Sea at the mouth of the west flowing drainage ditch along the
southern edge of the parking area at the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ. In the early afternoon, when with Rosie and Chris Howard, we
were able to study the Eurasian Green-winged Teal, accompanied by a female
Green-winged Teal, as it feed in an area of shallow water west of the north-
south dike leading to Rock Hill. This duck looked similar to nearby adult
male Green-winged Teal. However, it lacked the vertical white stripe
separating the breast from the flanks, but instead had prominent white
horizontal stripes on each side separating the mantle from the flanks. In
addition, the green on the face was bordered by an obvious creamy colored
stripe that also extending downward from above the eyes to the gape. I now
believe this is the same “Common Teal” photographed at this location by Ed
Stonick on 26 March, and well described here by Kimball L. Garrett on 1
April. To my knowledge, this is only the second “Common Teal” known at the
Salton Sink, and the first in Imperial County.
