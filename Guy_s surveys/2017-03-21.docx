      I spent Tuesday, 21 March 2017 (6:45 AM to 4:15 PM), birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig
Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake, then drove north into
Brawley, stopping along the way at Sheldon Reservoir and at the area near
the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. In Brawley I stopping briefly
at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, then looked around part of
southwestern Brawley and Cattle Call Park. I then drove north to
Calipatria, stopping for a short time at Ramer Lake. From Calipatria I
continued northward by way of English and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. I then checked for water birds
along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and
from Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, spending a little time in the area
around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads and at the west end of
Young Road. I then drove southeastward to into Westmorland, then southward
along to Forrester Road, stopping briefly at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam
Lake and Fig Lagoon before heading west towards San Diego. There was cloud-

middle of the day, along with fairly strong winds in the morning and late
afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 65 to 85 degrees.
