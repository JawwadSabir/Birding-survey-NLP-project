       I spent Friday 29 March 2019 (6:15 AM to 6:15 PM) with Therese R.
Clawson checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south
shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview
Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake, then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping
to look at Sheldon Reservoir and the area around the intersection of Carter
and Fites Roads on the way. In Brawley we looked for birds at Cattle Call
Park. From Brawley we drove northwestward through Westmorland to Unit 1 of
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, spending much time there. From
there we drove northeastward to the west end of Young Road and looked for
birds along the south shore of the Salton Sea northeastward to Obsidian
Butte. We then continued eastward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and looked around the HQ buildings and at the freshwater ponds
adjacent to Rock Hill. We then drove northeastward by way of Sinclair,
Garst, Schrimpf and David Roads to the area at the marshy area at the
intersection of Davis and Pound Roads. From there we drove southeast by way
of McDonald Road, Highway 111 and Sinclair Road to the Calipatria State
Prison (looked unsuccessfully for a Franklin’s Gull seen here earlier in
the day by Ed Stonick of Pasadena). We then drove southwestward into
Calipatria, stopping to look at the east end of Date Street, and on
southwestward to the intersection of Sperry and Bowles Roads immediately
west of Calipatria. From there we drove southward through Brawley and on
south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro. After
spending time there, we drove westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Some high thin clouds throughout the day with light wind early in the
morning, and with temperatures ranging from 55 to 85 degrees.
