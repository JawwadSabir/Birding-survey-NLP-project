      I spent most of Wednesday, 13 July 2016 (5:45 AM-4:30 PM) in the
Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I
started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley, then made a brief stop in Brawley to look at
the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then proceeded northward to
Ramer Lake, spending a short time here, then on northward through
Calipatria to Niland. In Niland I birded north along International Avenue,
then westward along 4th Street and southward along Luna Avenue. I then
drove westward by way of Pound, Davis Roads and Schrimpf Roads to the north
end of Garst Road and checked for birds on Morton Bay. I then moved
southward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. From
here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from
Obsidian Butte southwestward to the west end of Young Road, stopping in the
area around Obsidian Butte and the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads.
I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From here I drove south eastward
through Westmorland into Brawley, spending a little time in the southwest
portion of Brawley. I then proceeded southward along Dogwood Road to
southeastern El Centro. From here I drove west the intersection of Carter
and Fites Roads, then southward, stopping briefly at Lakeview Golf Course
and Fig Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley. It was clear, with no
wind, and with temperatures ranging from 75 to 110 degrees.
