      I spent Friday 31 January 2020 (6:30 AM to 4:00 PM) with two others
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea, mostly looking at waterbirds. We started the day in
Brawley, looking at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spending
a little time in Cattle Call Park. From Brawley we drove to Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From there we then checked the
shoreline of the Salton Sea from the west end of Young Road to the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. At the HQ’s, spent time around the visitor
center and the area Rock Hill. We then continued eastward, stopping at the
north end of Garst Road, looking briefly at the wetlands at the
intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then spending a little time around
the south end of International Avenue in Niland. From Niland, we worked our
way southward, stopping at the Calipatria State Prison, Wiest Lake, Sheldon
Reservoir and ending the day at Fig Lagoon.
