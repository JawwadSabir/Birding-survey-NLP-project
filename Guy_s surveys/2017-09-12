    10-12 September 2017 - Salton Sea/Imperial Valley,                    				Imperial County

	On 10 September I arrived in the Imperial Valley in the late morning to look for birds ahead of meeting Jon L. Dunn and his WINGS Tour participants. After looking at Fig Lagoon and the adjacent Lakeview Golfcourse, I drove north on Forrester Road to Westmorland, looking at irrigated fields along the way, then looked at the south shore of the Salton Sea from the west end of Young Road to Obsidian Butte.
	On 11 September we (Jon L. Dunn and his WINGS Tour participants) started the day at Ramer Lake and the entrance area to Finney Lake, then moved west to look for birds along the south shore of the Salton Sea from the west end of Young Road to Rock Hill, and the area around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. In the afternoon I looked for irrigated fields northeast of Calipatria, and checked for migrant land-birds immediately to the west of Calipatria.
	On 12 September we (Jon L. Dunn and his WINGS Tour participants) started the day at the IID Wetlands near Niland, then looked for land-birds in Niland. We then drove northwestward to the Wister Unit HQ, and later in the morning looked for land-birds in the area immediately west of Calipatria. I then left Jon L. Dunn and his WINGS Tour participants, and looked at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From there I drove southeastward into Brawley, then south to El Centro, stopping at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before driving west to San Diego.
