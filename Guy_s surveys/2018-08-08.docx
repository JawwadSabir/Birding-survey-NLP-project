       I spent Wednesday, 8 August 2018 (6:00 AM to 5:00 PM) checking
locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea, spending the morning
looking through shorebirds, and stopping at select locations in the
Imperial Valley in the afternoon. I started the day at the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge HQ and around Rock Hill, including walking along
the shore of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to the west end of Sinclair Road
(I encountered ankle-deep mud which limited my ability to carefully view
all the shorebirds in that area). I then checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the
north end of Poe Road. From there I returned to the west end of Young Road
and retraced my tracks back to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ.
I then drove east to Highway 111, and south through Calipatria to Brawley,
stopping briefly at Ramer Lake. In Brawley I looked for land-birds in
Riverview Cemetery and Cattle Call Park. I then drove south by way of
Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro, then west to
Lakeview Golfcourse and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      There was partial cloud cover, some wind from the southeast in the
morning, high humidity and temperatures ranging from 85 to 105 degrees.
      I failed to find any irrigated fields attracting large numbers of
shorebirds and gulls.

at the boat-ramp at Obsidian Butte. Both were slightly smaller than the
accompanying Western Sandpipers, being shorter but stockier, and a little
larger than the nearby Least Sandpipers. The pale fringes on the mantle and
wing-covert feathers created a uniform “scaly” appearance to the upper-
parts, and both lacked the rufous present on juvenile Western Sandpipers.
The under-parts on both were unmarked white with a pale buffy wash on the
breast. The short black bill on both appeared “blunt-ended”, and both had
black legs.), Western Sandpiper (3000), Least/Western Sandpipers (3500 –
