      We (Therese R. Clawson) spent the Saturday, 21 April 2018 (5:45 AM to
5:45 PM) checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the
south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Sheldon Reservoir,
then moved northward to the area at the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley. From here we drove northward to the area around
Calipatria, checking for water-birds on Young Reservoir and looking at
gulls at the west end of Date Street in Calipatria. We then continued
northward to Niland, stopping at the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland we
I birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then
south along Luna Avenue. From there we drove southwestward by way of
Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward
by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and
looking at Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and
from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, and southwestward to
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. We then drove
southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley we quickly
looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call
Park. From here we drove eastward to Dogwood Road and south to near the
southeastern corner of El Centro. From there I drove west to Lakeview Golf
Course and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      It was mostly clear, but with cloud-cover in the late afternoon, and
with virtually no, and with temperatures ranging from 50 to 95 degrees.
