      I spent Tuesday, 13 November 2018 (6:00 AM to 4:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Young Reservoir near Calipatria, then drove north
through Calipatria to Niland. In Niland I birded north along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. I then drove
south to the IID Wetlands, spending most of the time that I was there at
the northeastern corner. I then drove westward to Morton Bay by way of
McDonald, Davis and Schrimpf Roads, stopping to look through shorebirds at
the intersection of McDonald and Davis Roads, and for gulls near the
intersection of Davis and Schrimpf Roads. From Morton Bay I drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending much time around the Refuge HQ buildings
and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and
between Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. I then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
there I drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I
looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery and Cattle Call Park, and briefly at
the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then drove southwestward on
Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake, stopping to look at Sheldon
Reservoir, and ended the day at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon.
      Partially overcast with little to no wind throughout the day, and with
temperatures ranging from 40 to 70 degrees.
      When looking through the large flocks of Snow and Ross’s Geese, it is
very apparent that there are exceptionally few hatch-year Snow Geese
suggesting poor nesting success, and that the number of blue-morph Snow
Geese is less than in recent winters.
