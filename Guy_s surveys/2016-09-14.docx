I spent most of Wednesday, 14 September 2016 (6:30 AM-4:30 PM) along the
shore of the Salton Sea and at a few select spots in the Imperial Valley.
Much of my time was spent looking along the shore for noteworthy waterbirds
and offshore for such birds as jaegers and Sabine’s Gulls.  I started the
day checking the shore in Salton City, then drove south to Poe Road. From
here I drove straight to the west end of Young Road and slowly worked
northeastward to Rock Hill, spending time in the area around the
intersection of Lack and Lindsey and Obsidian Butte. I then moved eastward
to Morton Bay. From here I drove east to the algae farm east of Highway 111
south of Sinclair Road. I then drove south into Brawley where I spent a
little time at Riverview Cemetery, the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue, in Cattle Call Park and at Vida Park west of the hospital. I then
drove south on Forrester Road, and looked at Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golf
Course and Fig Lagoon before driving west to San Diego. It was windy in the
early morning, but calm by mid- afternoon, with mostly clear sky, and
temperatures ranging from 65 to 95 degrees.
      From what I could determine in the afternoon, migrant flycatchers
were present in reasonable numbers, but wood-warbler numbers were down from
four days ago.
