      I spent Sunday, 18 September 2016 (6:15 AM-5:00 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Ramer Lake, then moved northward through Calipatria to the IID
Wetlands near Niland, stopping briefly at the algae farm south of Sinclair
Road on the east of Highway 111. I then continued northward into Niland
where I birded north along International Avenue, west along the western
part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward
by way of Noffsinger, English, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to the north
end of Garst Road and checked for birds on Morton Bay. I then moved
southwestward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked
for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to
Obsidian Butte. I then looked along the shore of the Salton Sea from
Obsidian Butte to the north end of Poe Road, spending time in the area
around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young
Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I then
drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, and spent time in
Riverview Cemetery, at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and in
Cattle Call Park (many birds attracted to a puddle of water in the picnic
area in Cattle Call Park). From here I proceeded southward by way of
Forrester Road to Sunbeam Lake and Lakeview Golf Course, and ended the day
at and Fig Lagoon. It was clear with virtually no wind, and with
temperatures ranging from 65 to 105 degrees.
