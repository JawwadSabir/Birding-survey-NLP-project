      I spent Thursday, 18 May 2017 (5:30 AM to 6:00 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north to the area around the intersection of
Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley. I then continued north,
through Brawley, to Ramer Lake. From here I continued north to Niland,
stopping at the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound
and Davis Roads to the southwestern corner of the Wister Unit. From here I
drove south along Davis and west along Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then
south on Garst and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. I then spent time around the Refuge HQ’s and Rock Hill.
From here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea
between Rock Hill and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along the
south shore of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge, spending a little time in the area around the intersection of Lack
and Lindsey Roads and at the west end of Young Road. I then drove
southeastward through Westmorland and Brawley, then south on Dogwood Road
to near the southeastern corner of El Centro. After spending time near El
Centro, I drove west and looked at Fig Lagoon before continuing west to San
Diego.
      The sky was clear with some wind during the mid-morning, and with
temperatures ranging from 60 to 90 degrees.
      A few late migrant shorebirds, along with some obvious non-breeding
birds, were the only non-summer resident Charadridae encountered, with
gulls being close to non-existent. Yellow Warblers, along with Willow
Flycatchers and Warbling Vireos, were by far the most conspicuous migrant
land-birds.
