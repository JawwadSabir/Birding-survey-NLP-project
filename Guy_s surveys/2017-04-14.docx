      I spent Friday, 14 April 2017 (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north into Brawley, stopping along the way briefly
at Sheldon Reservoir and for much longer in the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. In Brawley I looked briefly at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, then spent a little time around part
of southwestern Brawley and in Cattle Call Park. I then drove north to
Niland, stopping at the east end of Date Street in Calipatria and at the
northeast corner of the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded quickly
northward along International Avenue, west along Noffsinger Road, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then south on Garst and west on
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill.
I then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from
Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte and, from Obsidian Butte along the south shore
of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge,
spending a little time in the area around the intersection of Lack and
Lindsey Roads and at the west end of Young Road. I then drove southeastward
through Westmorland into Brawley and south on Dogwood Road to near the
southeastern corner of El Centro. After spending time in El Centro, I drove
west, and looked at Fig Lagoon before heading west to San Diego.
      There some high cloud-cover part of the day, with some light wind in
the morning, and with temperatures ranging from 55 to 85 degrees.
      Numbers of ducks have continued to decline as these birds depart for
breeding grounds to the north; I encountered a nice variety of shorebirds,
and the number and variety of migrant passerines was to me impressive.
