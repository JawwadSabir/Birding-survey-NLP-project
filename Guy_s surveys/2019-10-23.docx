      I spent Wednesday 23 October 2019 (6:30 AM to 5:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started at the IID Wetlands, spending some time around the northeast
corner of the Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands I drove north into Niland. In
Niland I birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th
Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove westward by way of
Alcott, English and Pound Roads to the wet area at the intersection of
Pound and Davis Roads, then southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to
Morton Bay. From Morton Bay I drove southwestward by way of Garst and
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and spent time
around the Refuge HQ buildings. I then looked at the ponds adjacent to Rock
Hill and along the shore towards the west end of Sinclair Road. From there
I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the
west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to
the west end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From Unit 1 I drove westward to Poe
Road (shoreline too distant), stopping at Carter Reservoir on the way. I
then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at the
area of shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86 on
the way. In Brawley I looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call Park. I then drove
southward by way of Forrester Road to Sunbeam Lake and Fig Lagoon, stopping
to look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way.
      Clear sky with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranged from
65 to 95 degrees.
