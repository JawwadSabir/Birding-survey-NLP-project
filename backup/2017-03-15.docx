      I spent Wednesday, 15 March 2017 (6:45 AM to 4:45 PM) birding select
locations within the Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of
the Salton Sea. I started the day near the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove into Brawley. In Brawley, I looked
at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spent a little time in
Cattle Call Park. I then drove northward to Niland, stopping at Ramer Lake
[remarkably few birds] and the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded
northward along International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th
Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of
Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf to Morton Bay, then south on Garst and
east on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and
Rock Hill. I then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton
Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and, from Obsidian Butte along the
south shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending a
little time in the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads,
at the west end of Young Road, Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and Carter Reservoir. I then drove southeastward to into
Westmorland, then southward along to Forrester Road, stopping briefly at
Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before
heading west towards San Diego. There was broken cloud-cover most of the
day, with virtually no wind, and temperatures ranging from 55 to 95
degrees.
      The number of Brown Pelicans and Double-crested Cormorants has
decreased substantially throughout the area covered, and Caspian and
Forrester’s Terns remain non-existent along the shore of the Salton Sea.
However, a few Eared Grebes were to be found on the Salton Sea itself, and
the number of shorebirds, particularly Long-billed Dowitchers, has
increased. Numbers of gulls along the shore were well down, presumably
because most have now moved northward, while Ring-billed Gulls remain
abundant, particularly so at irrigated fields.
      Species seen and/or heard – Snow Goose (85 – eighty-five, including
two blue-morph birds, at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
