      While Guy was away at WFO in Albuquerque, I spent Monday 26 August
2019 (6:15 AM to 7:15 PM) checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley
and along the south shore of the Salton Sea, generally following his route
from 14 August but skipping restricted access areas. I started the day at
Sheldon Reservoir, then stopped briefly at Carter Rd. & Fites Rd. I next
scanned Ramer Lake looking through the large number of herons and
cormorants. From Ramer Lake I drove northward through Calipatria to the IID
Wetlands, spending some time around the northeast corner of the Wetlands.
From the IID Wetlands I continued north into Niland. In Niland I birded the
southern end of International Avenue and then the sewage facility on the
west side of town. From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott and
English Roads and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. I then drove south on
Davis Road to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads,
then southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, stopping
briefly to scan the water north of Schrimpf Road. From Morton Bay I drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. I spent a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings,
then drove to Obsidian Butte. From there I drove south along the sea wall,
stopping at Lack Rd. and Grubel Rd., and then the west end of Young Rd. I
then drove south to the area of shallow water at the intersection of Lack
Road and Highway 86 before driving to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge where I scanned from the viewing platform. From Unit 1 I
drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at Cattle
Call Park. I ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
