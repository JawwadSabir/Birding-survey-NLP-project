      I spent the Saturday morning, 17 March 2018 (6:30 AM to 11:30 AM)
checking a few locations in the southern part of the Imperial Valley. I
started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam Lake, then drove northward to the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, stopping at
Sheldon Reservoir on the way. I then drove eastward to Dogwood Road and
south to near the southeastern corner of El Centro. From there I drove west
to Lakeview Golf Course and ended the morning at Fig Lagoon.
      It was mostly clear with only a light wind early in the day, but with
increased cloud-cover and a strong wind from the west when I departed.
Temperatures ranged from 45 to 70 degrees.

this winter, indicating a strong movement of spring migrants through the
Imperial Valley), Nashville Warbler (1 – one well marked male with a
prominent eye-ring at Lakeview Golf Course establishes the earliest date
for a spring migrant at the Salton Sink - one near El Centro 18 Mar 2006
established the previous early date), Common Yellowthroat (1) and Yellow-
rumped Warbler (35) – 96 species.
      The single (1) Mew Gull was a first-winter bird with many other gulls
evidently attracted from the adjacent the Imperial Landfill to the water in
an irrigated field at the intersection of Robinson and Dogwood Roads. This
gull was noticeably smaller than the numerous California Gulls, and
appeared smaller than a nearby Ring-billed Gull. The head was white with
much brown mottling, especially so on the nape and hind-neck, and the small
thin bill was mostly blackish with pale pinkish at the base. The coverts
were worn and faded, and the long primaries were dark brownish with pale
fringes at the tips. The mantle was close to the same gray as that on the
California Gulls, and clearly darker than that on a nearby Ring-billed
Gull. Mew Gulls are rare at the Salton Sink, and this is the first that I
have encountered here this winter.
      All four (4) Violet-green Swallows were with a flock of about 700
swallows, mostly Trees but with a number of Barn and a few Cliffs, at
Carter Reservoir. This flock spent much time perched on the utility lines
along the south side of the reservoir, but with some always in flight,
primarily over the open water of the reservoir. I was easily able to view
the perched birds with the aid of my telescope and managed to identify
three males and one female Violet-green Swallow amongst them. I noted that
the Violet-green Swallows were smaller than the similar looking Tree
Swallows and had proportionately shorter tails. The white on the face of
the three males extended upward behind and part way over the eyes, the
white on the under-parts extended well up onto the rump, and the mantle was
noticeably green. The white on the face of the female was clouded, but the
white on the sides of the rump appeared as prominent as that on the males.
      I believe Violet-green Swallows are very rare in the Imperial Valley,
these being the first that I have seen in more than five years despite much
looking.
