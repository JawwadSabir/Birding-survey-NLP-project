      I spent Friday 22 November 2019 (5:45 AM to 4:15 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. Recent heavy rain left most unpaved roads impassable, limiting where I
could drive. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and nearby Sunbeam Lake (dry
ground), then drove north into Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir
(muddy), but unable to access the area around the intersection of Carter
and Fites Roads, on the way. In Brawley I looked at the hummingbird feeders
on Willard Avenue and for landbirds in Cattle Call Park. I then continued
north to Calipatria, stopping at Wiest Lake, Young Reservoir and the ponds
near the southeast corner of Calipatria. From Calipatria I drove northward
to the IID Wetlands and Niland by way of the Calipatria State Prison. At
them IID Wetlands I was only able to check the riparian growth at the
northeast corner. In Niland I found International Avenue closed due to
flooding. From Niland I wound my way to the north end of Garst Road having
to avoid all dirt roads. From the north end of Garst Road I drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. I spent time around the Refuge HQ buildings, then
looked at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill and along the shore towards the
west end of Sinclair Road (gravel road drivable). I was unable to drive to
the viewing spots on Obsidian Butte (muddy). I then checked the shoreline
of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then
drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
(gravel entry road drivable). From Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge I headed south to Interstate Highway 8 by way of
Westmorland and Forrester Road, making my final stops at Sheldon Reservoir,
Sunbeam Lake and Fig Lagoon.
