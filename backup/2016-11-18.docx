       17 November 2016 - Salton Sea/Imperial Valley, Imperial County.


      I spent Friday, 17 November 2016 (6:00 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golf Course and Sunbeam Lake, then continued
northward to Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir, and at the area around
the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way. In Brawly I only
looked briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then
continued northward to Niland, stopping at the algae farm adjacent to
Highway 111 south of Sinclair Road, and at the willows at the northeast
corner of the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded north along
International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound,
Davis, Schrimpf, Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along
the south shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending
time in the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the
west end of Young Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge. I then drove southeastward to Westmorland, then southward by way of
Forrester Road to Fig Lagoon, stopping only at Sheldon Reservoir on the
way. It was mostly clear with virtually no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 45 to 75 degrees.
      Land-birds continue in lower than expected numbers and with no
unexpected species.
