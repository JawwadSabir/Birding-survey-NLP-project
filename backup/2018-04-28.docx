      I spent Saturday, 28 April 2018 (5:45 AM to 4:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam Lake, then moved northward
to the area at the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of
Brawley, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way. From there I
drove northward to the area around Calipatria, checking for water-birds on
Young Reservoir and looking for gulls at the west end of Date Street in
Calipatria (none present). I then continued northward to Niland, stopping
at the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove northwestward by way of highway 111 to the Wister Unit
HQ. I then drove south on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, and
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the
north end of Poe Road. I then drove southeastward through Westmorland into
Brawley. In Brawley I quickly looked through Riverview Cemetery, at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call Park. From there I
drove southwestward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Lakeview Golf
Course, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on the way, and ended the day at Fig
Lagoon.
      It was mostly clear with no wind most of the day, but with some wind
in the early morning and strong wind in the late afternoon, and with
temperatures ranging from 60 to 95 degrees.
