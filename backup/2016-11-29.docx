      I spent Tuesday, 29 November 2016 (6:15 AM-3:45 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golf Course and Sunbeam Lake, then continued
northward to Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir, and at the area around
the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way. In Brawly I only
looked briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then
continued northward to Niland, stopping at the algae farm adjacent to
Highway 111 south of Sinclair Road, and at the IID Wetlands on the way. In
Niland I birded north along International Avenue, west along the western
part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward
by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis, Schrimpf, Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along
the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from
Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of
Poe Road, spending time in the area around the intersection of Lack and
Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge. I then drove southeastward to Westmorland, then
southward by way of Forrester Road to Fig Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon
Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way. It was clear with virtually no wind,
and with temperatures ranging from 40 to 70 degrees.
      Land-birds continue in lower than expected numbers.
