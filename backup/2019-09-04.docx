      I spent Wednesday 4 September 2019 (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM) with Mark
Stratton checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the
south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Ramer Lake looking
through the large number of herons and ibis. From Ramer Lake we drove
northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands, spending some time around
the northeast corner of the Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands we continued
north into Niland. In Niland we birded northward along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there we
drove northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and Highway 111 to
the Wister Unit HQ. From there we drove south on Davis Road to the wet area
at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then southwestward on Davis
and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay we drove southwestward by
way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. We spent a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at
the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill. We then checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. We then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
Unit 1 we drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping at
an area of shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86.
In Brawley we only looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery. We then drove
south to the southeast corner of El Centro, and ended the day at Fig
Lagoon.
      Partially cloudy, especially so in the afternoon, with virtually no
wind and temperatures ranged from 85 to 115 degrees.
      Wind during the morning in the area around Niland made for difficult
landbirding, but there was nice selection of migrant land-birds (mostly
wood warblers) near the southeast corner of El Centro in the afternoon.
