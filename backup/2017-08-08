8 August 2017-Salton Sea/Imperial Valley, Imperial County.
I spent Tuesday, 8 August 2017 (6:00 AM to 5:00 PM)
birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley
and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day in the area at the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley, then moved north through
Brawley to Ramer Lake. I then continued northward to the
IID Wetlands, and into Niland. In Niland I birded northward
along International Avenue, west along 4 th Street, then
south along Luna Avenue. I then drove northwestward by way
of Alcott, English and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ.
From there I drove southward by way of Davis and Schrimpf
Roads to Morton Bay and the north end of Garst Road,
stopping briefly at the intersection of Pound and Davis
Roads. From there I drove south on Garst and west on
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. After spending a little time at Rock Hill, I checked
for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between
the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from
Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From there I returned
to the west end of Sinclair Road. I then drove east on
Sinclair Road to Blair Road, south along Blair Road (an
irrigated field attracting many birds), then into
Calipatria and south into Brawley. In Brawley, I looked
briefly at Riverside Cemetery and Jeffrey Thornton Park. I
then drove south on Dogwood Road to the southeast corner of
El Centro where I spent a little time. After that, I drove
westward to Fig Lagoon, then continuing west to San Diego.
It was clear with little to no wind, and with
temperatures ranging from 85 to 115 degrees.
The only Gull-billed Terns remaining at Rock Hill were
those few pairs with flightless and begging young and five
on the nearby shore. Black Skimmer numbers appeared
unchanged, and included a number of flightless young.
Shorebird habitat at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge was somewhat limited. Migrant land-birds
were few and far between.
