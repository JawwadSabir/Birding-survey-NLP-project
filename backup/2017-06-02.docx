      I spent Friday, 2 June 2017 (5:30 AM to 4:00 PM) birding a few select
locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I started the day at the IID Wetlands southwest of Niland, then
moved north into Niland. In Niland I birded northward along International
Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna
Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, English, Highway 111 and
Davis Roads, stopping briefly at the Wister Unit HQ, to the southwestern
corner of the Wister Unit. From here I drove south along Davis and west
along Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then south on Garst and west on
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. I then looked
around the Refuge HQ’s and Rock Hill. From here I checked for water birds
along the shoreline of the Salton Sea between Rock Hill and Obsidian Butte,
and from Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to the
north end of Poe Road, spending a little time in the area around the
intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, at the west end of Young Road, Unit
1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and at Carter Reservoir. From
Poe Road I drove southeastward through Westmorland and into Brawley. In
Brawley I looked at Riverview Cemetery, the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue, and Cattle Call Park. I then moved south on Carter, Forrester and
Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake, stopping briefly in the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley on the way,
then looked at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before continuing west to
San Diego.
      The sky was clear with no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 60
to 95 degrees.
      Clearly most of the waterfowl have left the area, only a handful of
summering shorebirds and gulls remain along the south shore of the Salton
Sea, migrant land-birds are few and far between.

of Poe road are likely attempting to summer locally), Gadwall (2), American
