      I spent Sunday 23 June 2019 (5:15 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam Lake (gate closed at
Lakeview Golfcourse), then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping at the
area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. From Brawley I
drove northward through Calipatria to Niland, stopping at Ramer Lake, the
Earthrise Nutritionales Facility and the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded
northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south
along Luna Avenue. From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott,
English and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. I then drove south on Davis
Road to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, stopping
to look for waterbirds at a shallow water impoundments near the southwest
corner of the Wister Unit (now nearly dry). I then drove southwestward on
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay and Red Hill, then southwestward by
way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking
at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, then
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
there I drove southward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I
looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, at Cattle Call Park and Jeffrey
Thornton Park. I then drove south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast
corner of El Centro, and ended the day at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig
Lagoon.
      Clear with no wind, and temperatures ranging from 65 to 100 degrees.
      An obvious arrival of Brown Pelicans, but still virtually no Laughing
or Yellow-footed Gulls.
