      I spent Wednesday, 15 February (6:00 AM to 5:00 PM), with most of that
time with Curtis A. Marantz looking for three specific birds, but also
birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley and along part of
the south shore of the Salton Sea. I met CAM at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge at about 7:00 AM where we failed to see the Tundra
Swan reported since 26 December. From here we went to Brawley, stopping
briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spending much time
in Cattle Call Park attempting to relocate the Hutton’s Vireo found here on
8 February. We then returned to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge where we finally found the Tundra Swan. We then looked at nearby
Carter Reservoir, and drove northeastward to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill, stopping to look at Mountain Plovers near
the south end of Gentry Road on the way. From here we returned to Brawley
for a late lunch, then drove south through Calipatria to El Centro,
spending much time near the southeast corner of El Centro looking for a
Brown Thrasher believed to be wintering locally. At about 3:30 PM I left
CAM and headed west, stopping at Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golf Course and Fig
Lagoon before continuing west towards San Diego at about 5:00 PM. There was
some high broken cloud-cover most of the day, with virtually no wind, and
temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees.
      It was apparent that a number of the geese had left the Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, probably heading northward towards the
Arctic where they nest.
