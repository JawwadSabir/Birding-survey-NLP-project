      I spent Tuesday 30 April 2019 (6:00 AM to 6:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping briefly at Sheldon Reservoir
and longer to look at the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads on the way. In Brawley I only looked at Cattle Call Park. From
Brawley I drove northward through Calipatria to Niland, stopping to look
for waterbirds at the Earthrise Nutritionales Facility and for land-birds
in the willows at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands. In Niland I
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and
south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott,
English and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ and spent a little time
there. I then drove south on Davis Road to the wet area at the intersection
of Pound and Davis Roads. From there I drove southwestward on Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and
Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the
ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of
the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte,
from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, and southwestward to
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe
Road (nothing besides Black-necked Stilts and a few Western Sandpipers). I
then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, then south along
Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro, stopping at the
Branches Hunting Club (nearly dry with few birds) on the way. After
spending time near the southeast corner of El Centro, I drove westward and
ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Mostly clear throughout the day with light wind in the morning that
increased through the day to a strong wind in the late afternoon, and with
temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees.
