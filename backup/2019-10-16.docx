      I spent Wednesday 16 October 2019 (6:30 AM to 5:00 PM) with Paul Chad
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea. We started at the IID Wetlands, spending some time
around the northeast corner of the Wetlands. From the IID Wetlands we drove
north into Niland. In Niland we birded northward along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there we
drove westward by way of Alcott, English and Pound Roads to the wet area at
the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then southwestward on Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay we drove southwestward by way
of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ
and spent time around the Refuge HQ buildings. We then looked at the ponds
adjacent to Rock Hill and along the shore towards the west end of Sinclair
Road. From there we checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton
Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from
Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. We then drove southwestward
to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From Unit 1 we drove
to the area of shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway
86, then northeastward to the Earthrise Nutritionales Facility north of
Calipatria (many gulls and stilts but little else), then south through
Calipatria into Brawley. In Brawley we looked for birds in Riverview
Cemetery, at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call
Park. We then drove southward by way of Forrester Road to Sunbeam Lake and
Fig Lagoon, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way.
      Mostly clear sky with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranged
from 55 to 95 degrees.
      I was surprised to see no Black or Caspian Terns considering the
number seen only five days ago.
