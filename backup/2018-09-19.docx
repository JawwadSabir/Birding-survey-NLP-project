      I spent Wednesday, 19 September 2018 (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a
few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I started the day at Ramer Lake, then drove northward to the
IID Wetlands south of Niland, stopping to look at the Earthrise algae plant
at Hoober Road on the way. I then drove northward into Niland where I
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and
south along Luna Avenue. I then drove northwestward by way of Alcott and
English Roads and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. After birding around
the Wister Unit HQ I drove south through the Wister Unit on Davis Road and
west on Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay, stopping to look at the wet area at
the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads and the open water at the
intersection of Schrimpf and Davis Roads. I then drove southwestward by way
of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ.
After spending time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock
Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between
the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte
to the west end of Young Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge (no shorebird habitat remaining) and
the north end of Poe Road (large numbers of shorebirds present). From there
I drove southeastward into Brawley, stopping to look at a wet area at the
intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86 (heavy equipment working and area
almost dry so less than 100 shorebirds present). In Brawley I spent a
little time in Riverside Cemetery, then looked briefly at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call Park. I then drove south to
near the southeastern corner of El Centro, and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      There was partial cloud-cover with no wind until about 3:00 PM when a
strong wind from the southeast developed, and temperatures ranged from 70
to 100 degrees.

      The single (1) adult Lesser Black-backed Gull was on the shore of the
Salton Sea with other gulls, including one adult Yellow-footed Gull, near
the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. This was an obvious dark-
mantled Gull, having the mantle close to, but not quite as dark as that on
the nearby Yellow-footed Gull. The bird was larger than the accompanying
Ring-billed Gulls, and smaller than the Yellow-footed Gull, so judged to be
about the same size or slightly larger than a California Gull. The black
primaries (white tips greatly reduced probably due to wear) extended well
beyond the tip of the tail giving the bird a more elongated appearance than
that of the Yellow-footed Gull. The head, neck and under-parts were white
with a few flecks of gray-brown on the head. The eyes were pale yellow, the
slim bill was yellow with a red patch at the gonydeal angle, and the legs
were yellow, but not the chrome-yellow as on the Yellow-footed Gull.
      Lesser Black-backed Gulls are now rare but regular winter visitors to
the Salton Sea, with most between mid-September to late March.
      The single (1) Roseate Spoonbill was foraging in shallow water at the
western end of the pond running parallel to the south side of Schrimpf Road
immediately west of Davis Road. The bird was noticeably larger than the two
Snowy Egrets with which it was associating. From the distance I was viewing
this bird (I was at the east end of the pond) it appeared pale pink, palest
on the head and neck. The spatulated bill was pale yellowish, and the legs
were reddish. The bird was moving its bill back and forth through the water
as it slowly walked forward. An unmistakable immature.
      Roseate Spoonbills are very rare sporadic visitors to the Salton Sea.
