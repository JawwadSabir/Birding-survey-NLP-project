      I spent Wednesday, 31 January 2018 (6:30 AM to 5:00 PM) with Art Wang
from Washington birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley
and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day in Brawley
looking briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spending
some time in Cattle Call Park. From Brawley we drove northward to the IID
Wetlands near Niland, stopping at Young Reservoir southeast of Calipatria,
and at the Earthrise Nutritionales Facility (algae farm) north of
Calipatria on the way. At the IID Wetlands we only looking for land-birds
in the riparian growth at the northeast corner of the Wetlands (virtually
no birds). We then continued northward into Niland, where we birded
northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south
along Luna Avenue. From there we drove southwestward by way of Alcott,
Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of
Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ.
After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at
Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea
between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian
Butte to the west end of Young Road. From there we continued southwestward
to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, Carter Reservoir and
the north end of Poe Road. We then drove southeastward to Westmorland, then
south on Forrester Road and west on Ross Road to Fig Lagoon, stopping at
Sunbeam Lake on the way.
      The sky was clear, with virtually no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 45 to 80 degrees. Before dawn, we were treated to an
