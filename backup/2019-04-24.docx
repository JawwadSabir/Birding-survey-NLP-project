      I spent Wednesday 24 April 2019 (6:00 AM to 6:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping to look at the area around
the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way. In Brawley I looked
for birds at Cattle Call Park. From Brawley I drove northward through
Calipatria to Niland, stopping to look for waterbirds at the Earthrise
Nutritionales Facility, for gulls at the west end of Date Street in
Calipatria (none) and for land-birds in the willows at the northeast corner
of the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded northward along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there I
drove northwestward by way of Alcott, English and Highway 111 to the Wister
Unit HQ and spent time there. I then drove south on Davis Road to the wet
area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. From there I drove
southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward
by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and
looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along
the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, and
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I then
drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, stopping briefly at
Riverview Cemetery, then south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast
corner of El Centro, stopping at the Branches Hunting Club on the way.
After spending time near the southeast corner of El Centro, I drove
westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Mostly clear throughout the day with no wind, and with temperatures
ranging from 65 to 100 degrees.

      The single (1) Semipalmated Sandpiper was compared directly with
Western Sandpipers and one Least Sandpiper as it fed (pecking at the
surface of the mud rather than probing in the shallow water) along the
shore-line of one of the wet areas at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge. Fortunately this obvious “peep” was one of the closest to
my position on the dike-road - judged to be about 75 feet. This “peep” was
a little smaller than the Western Sandpipers, most actively feeding
(probing) in the shallow water, but larger than the one Least Sandpiper
also feeding (pecking at the surface of the exposed mud) along the shore-
line. This sandpiper lacked the obvious rufous scapulars present on all the
nearby Western Sandpipers and, as far as I could determine, also showed no
rufous on the crown or ear-coverts, leaving the upper-parts looking uniform
in color and pattern. The streaking on the under-parts was confined to the
breast and upper-flanks, with the rest of the flanks and under-parts being
unmarked white. The blackish short bill appeared blunt-tipped, and was
certainly shorter than that on any of the nearby Western Sandpipers. The
legs were clearly black rather than yellowish as on the Least Sandpiper.
