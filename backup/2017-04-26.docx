      I spent Wednesday, 26 April 2017 (5:45 AM to 5:45 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north to Brawley, stopping along the way briefly
at Sheldon Reservoir and for a much longer time in the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads. In Brawley I looked briefly at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, then spent a little time in Cattle
Call Park. I then drove north to Niland, stopping at the east end of Date
Street in Calipatria and at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands on the
way. In Niland I birded quickly northward along International Avenue, west
along 4th Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by
way of Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then south on
Garst and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. I then checked for water birds around Rock Hill and along the shoreline
of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, then from Obsidian
Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge, spending a little time in the area around the
intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads and at the west end of Young Road. I
then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley and south on
Dogwood Road to near the southeastern corner of El Centro. After spending
time in El Centro, I drove west, and looked at Fig Lagoon before heading
west to San Diego.
      There was some scattered high cloud-cover throughout the day, calm in
the morning but with wind in the late afternoon, and with temperatures
ranging from 55 to 95 degrees.
      Ducks, other than Northern Shovelers and Ruddy Ducks, are now scarce.
I encountered a nice variety of shorebirds even though the total number of
these birds was low. I also encountered a nice variety of migrant
passerines. The recent influx of California Gulls and Caspian Terns at Rock
Hill is of some concern since it could impact the success of the Gull-
billed Tern nesting.
