      I spent Friday 7 February 2020 (6:15 AM to 4:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I spent much time looking unsuccessfully for a possible Roseate
Spoonbill at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, and
sometime in the area east of Calipatria and the Calipatria State Prison
looking unsuccessfully for Mountain Plovers. I started the day in the area
around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley,
then drove northward into Brawley. In Brawley I looked briefly at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and spent a little time in and near
Cattle Call Park. From Brawley I drove northwestward to Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, spending considerable time there. I
then drove eastward to Calipatria and the looked at the farmland area east
of the Calipatria State Prison. I then checked the southern end of
International Avenue in Niland. From there I drove westward by way of
Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road. I then
drove southwestward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
looking around the visitor center and the area around Rock Hill, I checked
the shoreline from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to
the west end of Young Road. I then returned to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge. From there I continued westward to the north end
of Poe Road, stopping to look at Carter Reservoir on the way. After leaving
Poe Road, I drove southward to Fig Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on
the way.

75 degrees.
