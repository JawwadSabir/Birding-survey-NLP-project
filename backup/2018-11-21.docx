       I spent Wednesday, 21 November 2018 (6:15 AM to 4:15 PM), checking a
few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the
Salton Sea. I started the day at Wiest Lake, then moved northward to Ramer
Lake. From there I drove northward to the IID Wetlands, stopping to look at
Young Reservoir near Calipatria, and fields adjacent to Sinclair Road east
of Highway 111. I then continued northward into Niland. In Niland I birded
north along International Avenue, looked at the desert-like area
immediately northeast of Niland, then west along 4th Street, and south
along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward to Morton Bay by way of Alcott,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads, stopping briefly to look through waterbirds at
the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. From Morton Bay I drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending time around the Refuge HQ buildings and
looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and
between Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. I then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From
there I drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I
looked for birds in Cattle Call Park, and briefly at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue. I then drove southwestward on Forrester and Ross
Roads to Sunbeam Lake, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir, and ended the
day at Fig Lagoon.
      Partially overcast with little to no wind throughout the day, and with
temperatures ranging from 50 to 75 degrees.
      Brown Pelicans appear to have left the area. Passerines were in low
numbers.

indicated it was a hatch-year bird, probably a female due to the lack of
the orange knob on the bill), Bufflehead (5), Ruddy Duck (2500), Ring-
