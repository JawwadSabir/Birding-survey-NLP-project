      I spent Friday 5 April 2019 (6:15 AM to 6:15 PM) with Justyn T. Stahl
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse
and Sunbeam Lake, then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping to look at
Sheldon Reservoir and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads on the way. In Brawley we looked for birds at Cattle Call Park. From
Brawley we drove northwestward through Westmorland to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge. After spending time there we continued
westward to the north end of Poe Road. From there we drove northeastward to
the west end of Young Road and looked for birds along the south shore of
the Salton Sea northeastward to Obsidian Butte. We then continued eastward
to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and looked around the HQ
buildings and at the freshwater ponds adjacent to Rock Hill. We then drove
northeastward by way of Sinclair, Garst, Schrimpf and David Roads to the
the marshy area at the intersection of Davis and Pound Roads. From there we
drove eastward by way of McDonald Road to the northeastern corner of the
IID Wetlands south of Niland. We then drove southward by way of Highway 111
and Sinclair Road to the Calipatria State Prison. From there we drove
southwestward into Calipatria, stopping to look at the east end of Date
Street, and on southwestward to the intersection of Sperry and Bowles Roads
immediately west of Calipatria. We then drove southward into Brawley,
stopping briefly at Young Reservoir and Rammer Lake. In Brawley we looked
briefly at Riverview Cemetery, then continued south along Dogwood Road to
near the southeast corner of El Centro. After spending time there, we drove
westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Partial cloud-cover throughout the day with medium to strong wind,
and with temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees.
      Numbers of waterfowl continue to drop as birds move out of the area.
Some migrant shorebird numbers greatly reduced from those present a week
ago, and gulls are becoming scarce along the shoreline. Small numbers of
the early spring migrants passerines present.
