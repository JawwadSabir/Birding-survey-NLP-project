      I spent Thursday, 16 August 2018 (6:00 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley where I
quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I then drove
north to Ramer Lake, stopping at Riverview Cemetery as I left Brawley. From
Ramer Lake I continued northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland. I
then continued northward into Niland where I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. I
then drove northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and Highway 111
to the Wister Unit HQ. After birding around the HQ I drove south through
the Wister Unit on Davis Road and west on Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay,
stopping to look at the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis
Roads. I then drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I
then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From there I drove southeastward
through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I again looked for land-birds
in Riverview Cemetery and checked Cattle Call Park. I then drove south by
way of Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro, then west to
Lakeview Golfcourse and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      There was partial cloud cover, some wind from the southeast in the
morning, high humidity and temperatures ranging from 85 to 105 degrees.
      I failed to find any irrigated fields attracting large numbers of
shorebirds and gulls, and apart from Willow Flycatchers migrant passerines
were indeed scarce.
