      I spent Saturday, 5 May 2018 (5:45 AM to 6:00 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea, joined by Justyn T. Stahl in the afternoon. I started the day at the
IID Wetlands south of Niland. I then drove northward into Niland where I
birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and
south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove northwestward by way of English
Road and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. From there I drove south
through the Wister Unit on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings (I did not go to Rock Hill or look at the ponds between the HQ
Buildings and Rock Hill), I checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, from
Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road, and southwestward to Unit 1
of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. I
then drove back to the west end of Young Road where I was joined by Justyn
T. Stahl, and again checked the shoreline from there to Obsidian Butte and
the area around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. We then drove
south by way of Gentry and Forrester Roads to Interstate 8, stopping to
look at Sheldon Reservoir on the way, then southeastward by way of
Interstate 8 and Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro.
After spending about one-hour there we headed west, stopping briefly at
Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon.
      It was clear with no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 65 to
105 degrees.
      The number of shorebirds present was far less than on 2 May, with the
last of the migrant Least Sandpipers having evidently moved on northward.
In addition, the number of migrant passerines were also noticeably less
than on 2 May, with Wilson’s Warblers and Western Tanagers still the most
obvious.
