      I spent Thursday, 11 August 2016 (5:45 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea with Anne
Devillers and her fiancé Stan visiting from Belgium, along with her half-
sister Wendi from San Louis Obispo. We started the day Ramer Lake, then
moving on northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands near Niland. We
then proceeded northward to Niland where we birded north along
International Avenue, then westward along Noffsinger Road and southward
along Luna Avenue. We then drove westward by way Pound, Davis Roads and
Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for birds on
Morton Bay. We then moved southwestward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ and checked for birds around Rock Hill. From here we checked for
water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte
southwestward to the west end of Young Road, spending the most time in the
areas around Obsidian Butte and the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads.
We then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and on westward to the north end of Poe Road. From here we drove
south eastward through Westmorland into Brawley and spent time at Cattle
Call Park and elsewhere in the southwest portion of Brawley. We then
proceeded southward along Forrester Road and through Seeley to Fig Lagoon,
and I looked at Lakeview Golf Course before leaving the Imperial Valley. It
was partially cloudy with wind in the morning, with temperatures ranging
from 85 to 105 degrees and being somewhat humid.
