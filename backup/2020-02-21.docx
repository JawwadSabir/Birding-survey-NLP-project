      I spent Friday 21 February 2020 (6:15 AM to 5:15 PM) with Paul Chad
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea. We started the day in the area around the intersection
of Carter and Fites southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into
Brawley. In Brawley we looked briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue and spent time in Cattle Call Park. From Brawley we drove northward
to Niland, stopping at Wiest Lake, at the east end of Date Street in
Calipatria and the Calipatria State Prison on the way. In Niland we birded
northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south
along Luna Avenue. From there we drove westward by way of Alcott, English
and Pound Roads to the wet area at the intersection of Pound and Davis
Roads, then southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From
Morton Bay we drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and spent a little time around the
Refuge HQ buildings. We then looked at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill and
along the shore towards the west end of Sinclair Road. From there we
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road. We then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge. After spending time at Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge we drove westward to the north end of Poe
Road. We then drove southeastward through Westmorland and Brawley to the
area around the intersection of Dogwood and Keystone Roads. After looking
at the wetlands at the intersection of Dogwood and Keystone Roads, and at
the Branches Hunt Club along Dogwood Road south of Keystone Road, we drove
southwestward to Fig Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on the way.
