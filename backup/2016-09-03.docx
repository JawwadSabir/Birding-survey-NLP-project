      I spent Saturday, 3 September 2016 (6:15 AM-4:00 PM) with Bill Tweit
of Washington State in the Imperial Valley and along a small part of the
south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Ramer Lake, then moved
northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands near Niland, stopping at
the algae farm on the way. We then went northward into Niland where we
birded north along International Avenue and briefly along Luna Avenue
before going directly to Red Hill after receiving word about an Eastern
Kingbird there. After seeing the Eastern Kingbird, we looked for land-birds
around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and the checked for
water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea in the area between Rock
Hill and Obsidian Butte. We then returned to Niland and checked more
carefully for land-birds in the western part of the town. From here we
drove southwestward to the west end of Young Road (Reddish Egret seen here
by others) and looked along the shore of the Salton Sea northeastward to
the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. We then drove southward through
Westmorland into Brawley, spending time at Cattle Call Park and elsewhere
around the southwest portion of Brawley. From here we proceeded southward
by way of Dogwood Road to the southeast corner of El Centro, stopping at an
irrigated field just north of Keystone Road. We then stopped very briefly
at Lakeview Golf Course and Fig Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley
(Bill had a late afternoon flight to catch). It was clear with a light
breeze some of the time, with temperatures ranging from 75 to 105 degrees.
      We spent much time looking for land-birds away from the shore of the
Salton Sea, and did not stop at such normally productive water-bird
locations as Morton Bay, Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
or the north end of Poe Road.
