      I spent Wednesday, 3 May 2017 (5:45 AM to 5:00 PM), birding a few
select locations along the south shore of the Salton Sea and within the
Imperial Valley. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and
Sunbeam Lake, then drove north into Brawley, stopping along the way briefly
at Sheldon Reservoir in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads. In Brawley I looked briefly at the hummingbird feeders on
Willard Avenue, then spent a little more time in Cattle Call Park. I then
drove north to Niland, stopping at Ramer Lake and at the east end of Date
Street in Calipatria on the way. In Niland I birded quickly northward along
International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound
and Davis Roads to the southwestern corner of the Wister Unit. From here I
drove south along Davis Road and west along Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay,
then south on Garst and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. I then checked for water birds along the
shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from
Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, spending a little time in the area
around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads and at the west end of
Young Road. I then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley and
south on Dogwood Road to near the southeastern corner of El Centro. After
spending time in El Centro, I drove west and looked at Fig Lagoon before
continuing west to San Diego.
      There were a few scattered high clouds throughout the day, mostly
calm, and with temperatures ranging from 70 to 105 degrees.
      An evident influx of Brown Pelicans probably bought with them the
first of the post-breeding Yellow-footed Gulls. The presence of thirty
Western Grebes on Fig Lagoon, where no more than two have been in recent
weeks, were obvious migrants – but from the south or north is unknown.
Least Sandpipers are all but gone from the area, and I failed to see any
Tree Swallows suggesting this species has now moved northward from the
area.
