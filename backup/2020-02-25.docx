      I spent most of the morning on 25 February 2020 around the south shore
of the Salton Sea, specifically looking for recently reported Mountain
Plovers. I arrived in Westmorland at about 6:15 AM and immediately checked
the recently graded field north of Westmorland where Mountain Plovers were
reported during the past two days, but found none. I then moved
northwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge where I
spent some time. I then returned to the area north of Westmorland and found
Mountain Plovers in the graded field. From there, I drove northward and
birded the south shore of the Salton Sea from the west end of Young Road to
Obsidian Butte. I then made a quick stop at the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ and at the north end of Garst Road. From there I worked
my way southward to Westmorland, then on southward to Fig Lagoon, stopping
at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way, and heading west to San
Diego at 11:30 AM.
      Clear sky with temperatures ranging from 50 to 75 degrees and
increasing wind from the north after mid-morning.
      I managed to see 86 species of birds, most expected in the area
covered. Birds of note included: Greater White-fronted Goose (4 – four at
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge were the same four seen
here on 21 February), Tundra Swan (1 - one adult at Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge was the same bird first reported here on 14
January), Canvasback (15 – fifteen together on Sheldon Reservoir), Black-
bellied Plover (350 – about three-hundred-fifty together on the mudflats
off the west end of Young Road was a large number), Mountain Plover (120 –
one-hundred-twenty counted in a graded field adjacent to Forrester Road
north of Westmorland were first reported at this location on 23 February by
Greg Ward and the only ones that I have encountered this winter), Stilt
Sandpiper (95 – ninety-five counted in the southwestern part of Unit 1 of
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge), Wilson’s Phalarope (1 – one in
basic-plumage at the viewing platform in Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge was believed to be the same bird photographed here on 16
February by Sara Ngo and most likely wintered locally) and Ferruginous Hawk
(1 – one immature with white feathers on its legs in an irrigated field
adjacent to Gentry Road north of the New River).
