      I spent Thursday, 8 March 2018 (6:00 AM to 4:30 PM) birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of
the Salton Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golf Course and
Sunbeam Lake. I then drove north into Brawley with quick stops at Sheldon
Reservoir and at the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of
Brawley. In Brawley I looked briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue, and spent a little time in Cattle Call Park and at Riverview
Cemetery. From Brawley I drove northward to Wiest Lake, then continued
northward into Calipatria, stopping at Young Reservoir southeast of
Calipatria, and looking at farm yards west of Calipatria. From there I
drove northward by way of English, Hazard, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to
Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds
along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and
Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. From
there I continues southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge, then west to Carter Reservoir. From there I drove
southeastward into Brawley, then south on Forrester and Ross Roads to Fig
Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir and Sunbeam Lake on the way.

temperatures ranging from 55 to 85 degrees.
