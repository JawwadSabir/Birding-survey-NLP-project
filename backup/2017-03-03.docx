      I spent Wednesday, 3 March 2017 (6:00 AM to 4:00 PM), birding a few
select locations within the Imperial Valley and along part of the south
shore of the Salton Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove north into Brawley, stopping briefly to look at Sheldon
Reservoir and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads.
In Brawley I stopping briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue
and spent some time in Cattle Call Park. I then continued north to Niland,
stopping briefly to look for land-birds at the northeastern corner of the
IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded north along International Avenue, west
along the western part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I
then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis, Schrimpf, Garst and
Sinclair Roads to Morton Bay and the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge
HQ. I then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea
from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along the south
shore of the Salton Sea to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge, spending a little time in the area around the intersection of Lack
and Lindsey Roads and at the west end of Young Road. I then drove westward
to nearby Carter Reservoir and southeastward to into Westmorland. From here
I drove southward by way of Forrester and Ross Roads to Sunbeam Lake and
Fig Lagoon, then heading west to San Diego at about 4:00 PM. There was some
high broken cloud-cover part of the day, with virtually no wind, and
temperatures ranging from 45 to 80 degrees.
      It was apparent that a number of the wintering waterbirds had left,
diving ducks were on reservoirs and ditches rather than on the Salton Sea
itself, raptors were few and far between, and land-birds were hard to find.
