      I spent Friday 11 October 2019 (6:30 AM to 5:15 PM) with Jon L. Dunn
and a small group of Western Field Ornithologists officers and guests
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea.  We started the day at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge, then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley,
stopping to look at the area of shallow water at the intersection of Lack
Road and Highway 86. In Brawley we looked for birds in Cattle Call Park and
Riverview Cemetery. We then drove northward to the west end of Young Road.
From there we studied waterbirds along the southern edge of the Salton Sea
from the “seawall” northeastward to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte
eastward towards the west end of Sinclair Road. We then drove eastward to
the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, spending some time around the
parking area. We then drove northeastward by way of Sinclair, Garst,
Schrimpf, Davis and Pound Roads to the southern end of International Avenue
in Niland. After spending some time there, I departed, stopping at Sheldon
Reservoir and Fig Lagoon before heading west to San Diego.
      Clear sky with little to no wind, and with temperatures ranging from
50 to 80 degrees.
      Laughing and Yellow-footed Gulls, along with Brown Pelicans, appear to
have moved away from the south end of the Salton Sea.

      As I was on the viewing platform looking west watching ibis departing
from Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge just before 7:00 AM,
I saw a lone white “heron” flying towards me. I judged this “heron” to be
larger than a Snowy Egret and smaller than a Great Egret, both species
being present. The “heron” was flying with its neck stretched forward and
its legs extending well beyond the end of its tail. As it got close, I
thought I could see some pale pink on the wings, so concluded it was a
Roseate Spoonbill. As it passed almost directly over me, probably about 150
feet off the ground, and still flying eastward, I clearly saw the somewhat
pale spoon-shaped bill, and noted some grayish coloration on the tips of
the longest primaries. After passing over the viewing platform, it veered
southward, and I eventually lost view of the bird as it headed in a
southeasterly direction towards Highway 86.
