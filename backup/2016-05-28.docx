      I spent most of Saturday, 28 May 2016 (5:30 AM-3:45 PM) in the
Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I
started the day checking for birds near the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then moved north through Brawley and
Calipatria to Niland, stopping to look at Ramer Lake. In Niland I birded
north along International Avenue, then westward along 4th Street and
southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Pound,
English, Beach and Davis Roads to the southwestern corner of the Wister
Unit (still no Least Terns). From here I drove south by way of Davis and
Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for birds on
Morton Bay. I then drove southward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ. From here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte southwestward to the west end of Young Road,
spending time in the area around Obsidian Butte and the intersection of
Lack and Lindsey Roads. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From here I
drove south eastward through Westmorland into Brawley, and on eastward to
the Alamo River Wetlands. I then drove south to El Centro, spending some
time near the southeastern corner of El Centro. I then headed west to San
Diego, stopping briefly at Lakeview Golf Course and Fig Lagoon before
leaving the Imperial Valley. It was mostly clear (some clouds in the
afternoon) clear with little to no wind, and with temperatures ranging from
60 to 95 degrees.
