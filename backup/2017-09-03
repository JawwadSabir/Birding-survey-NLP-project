I spent Sunday, 3 September 2017 (6:15 AM to 4:15 PM) birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the day at Ramer Lake, then drove north to the IID Wetlands near Niland. From there I drove northward into Niland, where I birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue. I then drove south by way of Highway 111 to the area around the intersection of Sperry and Bowles Roads west of Calipatria, then on south to just north of Rutherford Road where I spent time at an irrigated field. I then drove northwestward by way of Kershaw Road into Calipatria, then on English and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending time around the refuge HQ buildings and Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then drove southeastward to Brawley. In Brawley, I looked at Riverview Cemetery, then spent a little time at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call Park. I then continued south by way of Dogwood Road to the southeastern corner of El Centro. Then, on my way west to San Diego, I stopped briefly at Fig Lagoon.
 It was overcast all day with light rain in the afternoon, little to no wind in the morning, but windy in the afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 80 to 90 degrees.
	The number of migrant land-birds were much less than they were three days ago, and few were attracted to standing water, especially so when it was raining.
