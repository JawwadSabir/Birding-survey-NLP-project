      We (Curtis A. Marantz) spent Wednesday, 12 September 2018 (6:15 AM to
6:15 PM) checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the
south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day in Brawley, where I
looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and checked the
adjacent residential area prior to the arrival of CAM, then spent a little
time in Riverview Cemetery. We then drove northward to Ramer Lake. From
Ramer Lake we continued northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland, then
northward into Niland where we birded northward along International Avenue,
west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. We then drove
northwestward by way of Alcott and English Roads and Highway 111 to the
Wister Unit HQ. After birding around the Wister Unit HQ we drove south
through the Wister Unit on Davis Road and west on Schrimpf Road to Morton
Bay, stopping briefly to look at the wet area at the intersection of Pound
and Davis Roads. We then drove southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair
Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a
little time around the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at Rock Hill, we
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road. We then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From there we
drove southeastward into Brawley, stopping to look at a wet area at the
intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86. After leaving CAM in Brawley, I
drove south by way of Forrester Road, stopping briefly at Sheldon
Reservoir, then west on Ross Road to Sunbeam Lake, and ended the day at Fig
Lagoon.
      The sky was clear with no wind until the late afternoon, and
temperatures ranging from 70 to 105 degrees.

      When we were birding at the east edge of Ramer Lake, I was attracted
to a dark gull-like bird flying eastward as if leaving the lake. The bird
was relatively close to us, so mostly showing its under-sides. Upon looking
with the use of my binoculars I saw that it was a jaeger showing the
characteristic white area at the base of the primaries on the under-sides
of the wings. In addition, I noted that the central tail-feathers were
slightly longer than the rest and appeared pointed. The undersides of the
wings were prominently barred/spotted as expected on hatch-year birds, and
I noted warmish cinnamon rather than cold grayish tones, especially so
about the head, showing that it was a Parasitic Jaeger rather than a Long-
tailed Jaeger.
      Parasitic Jaegers are rare but regular fall migrants on the Salton
Sea, with most recorded in September. However, this is the first that I
have seen away from the immediate vicinity of the Salton Sea.
      As we were about halfway along the dike road dividing Ramer Lake into
two parts, and looking northward to see what birds were on the open water
ahead of us, I started looking at the steady stream of swallows flying
towards me. CAM had just commented that a Purple Martin would be nice when
I saw, and heard, a hatch-year/female Purple Martin close to us and watched
it fly across the dike road as if to go to the southern part of the lake.
This was a large swallow, noticeably larger than the Tree Swallows with
which it was flying. The upper-parts appeared blackish, the head and breast
were dark, and the rest of the under-parts appeared pale grayish. Within
the next ten minutes two more Purple Martins did the same. The amount of
darkness on the head and breast varied between all three. CAM obtained
photos of one.
      Purple Martins are rare to casual spring migrants at the Salton Sink,
and even rarer there in fall, with only eight previously recorded between
23 August and 14 September – all eight involving single birds.
