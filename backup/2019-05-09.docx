      I spent Thursday 9 May 2019 (5:45 AM to 6:0 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir (gate
locked so no access) and the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads. From Brawley I drove northward through Calipatria to Niland,
stopping at Ramer Lake, the Earthrise Nutritionales Facility and the
willows at the northeast corner of the IID Wetlands. In Niland I birded
northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south
along Luna Avenue. From there I drove northwestward by way of Alcott,
English and Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. After spending a little time
there, I drove south on Davis Road to the wet area at the intersection of
Pound and Davis Roads, stopping to look at the shallow water impoundment
south of Beach Road. I then drove southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads
to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill, I
checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the
west end of Young Road, and southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge. From there I drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I only looked for birds in Riverview
Cemetery. I then drove south along Dogwood Road to near the southeast
corner of El Centro, stopping briefly at the Branches Hunting Club on the
way. After spending time near the southeast corner of El Centro, I drove
westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Partially overcast throughout the day with very light to no wind, and
with temperatures ranging from 65 to 90 degrees.
