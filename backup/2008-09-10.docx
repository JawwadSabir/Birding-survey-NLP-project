      I spent part of Sunday 8 September (1:00 PM to 6:30 PM), all of Monday
9 September (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM) and most of Tuesday 10 September 2019
(6:30 AM to 4:00 PM) checking locations in the Imperial Valley and along
the south shore of the Salton Sea, with most of that time with Jon L. Dunn
and seven WINGS participants.
      On Sunday, 8 September, I started at Fig Lagoon and moved northward to
Brawley, stopping briefly at Sheldon Reservoir and at the area around the
intersection of Carter and Fites southwest of Brawley. In Brawley I looked
for birds in Riverview Cemetery. I then drove northwestward to the area of
shallow water at the intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86 where joined
by John L. Dunn and the WINGS participants. We then spent the rest of the
day looking through gulls in two irrigated fields adjacent to Young Road
west of Gentry Road and looking for waterbirds along the south shore of the
Salton Sea between the west ends of Young and Lindsey Roads.
      On Monday, 9 September, we started the day at Finney Lake, then moved
northward to Ramer Lake. From there we continued northward, stopping once
west of Calipatria, on our way to the north end of Garst Road. From there
we went to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. We
then spent some time at Obsidian Butte. We then went south to Riverview
Cemetery in Brawley, then northwestward to the area of shallow water at the
intersection of Lack Road and Highway 86. We ended the day in Cattle Call
Park and at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue in Brawley.
      On Tuesday, 10 September, we started the day at the IID Wetlands south
of Niland. From there we moved northward to the southern end of
International Avenue in Niland. After spending time in Niland, we moved
northwestward to the Wister Unit HQ. From there we went south to the wet
area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. We then drove  southwest
to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and after some time, south
into Westmorland. I then looked for waterbirds at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea
National Wildlife Refuge, the area of shallow water at the intersection of
Lack Road and Highway 86, on Sheldon Reservoir and at Fig Lagoon before
heading west to San Diego.
      Temperatures on all three days ranged from about 75 to 100 degrees,
with partial cloud cover on Monday, with strong wind late in the day on
Monday, but otherwise little to no wind.
      Since we spent time doing our best to make sure all of the tour
participants saw the more noteworthy birds, and discussed field marks used
to identify those more noteworthy birds, the number of individuals for many
species reported is less than what was no doubt present.
      Species seen and/or heard – Blue-winged Teal (1,3,15 – ten “females”
