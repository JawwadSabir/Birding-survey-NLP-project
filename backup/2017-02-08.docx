      I spent Wednesday, 8 February (6:30 AM to 4:30 PM), with Paula
Theobald birding select locations within the Imperial Valley and along part
of the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon,
then stopped at Lakeview Golf Course, Sunbeam Lake and Sheldon Reservoir on
our way to Brawley. In Brawley, we looked at the hummingbird feeders on
Willard Avenue, then spent some time in Cattle Call Park. We then drove
northwestward through Westmorland to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge, detouring northward on the way to look at Mountain Plovers
near the south end of Gentry Road. We then drove northeastward to the west
end of Young Road and birded northeastward along the shore of the Salton
Sea to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and Rock Hill. We then
drove northeastward into Niland by way of Garst, Schrimpf, Davis, Pound,
English and Alcott Roads. We quickly looked around west Niland, along
International Avenue in East Niland and the northeast corner of the IID
Wetlands before heading south into Brawley. After looking at Cattle Call
Park for the second time, we headed southward along to Forrester Road,
stopping briefly at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake and Fig Lagoon before
heading west to San Diego at about 4:30 PM. There was broken cloud-cover
most of the day, increasing in the afternoon, with virtually no wind, and
temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees.
      The decrease in Double-crested Cormorant and shorebirds numbers along
the south shore of the Salton Sea continues, along with the virtual non-
existence of Eared Grebes, and absence of Western and Clark’s Grebes, and
Caspian and Forester’s Terns. Again I was unable to find any Western
Sandpipers.

species.
      The single (1) Hutton’s Vireo was well seen foraging in the thick
vegetation along the New River at Cattle Call Park in Brawley with two Ruby-
crowned Kinglets for direct comparison. The Hutton’s Vireo appeared to be
similar in coloration to, but a little larger than, the Ruby-crowned
Kinglets with a noticeably heavier bill. The lores on the Hutton’s Vireo
were whitish and the eye-ring was restricted to the rear half of the eyes
giving the vireo a noticeably different facial appearance. As on the Ruby-
crowned Kinglet, the Hutton’s Vireo had two prominent white wing-bars, but
unlike the Ruby-crowned Kinglet, it lacked the obvious black on the folded
primaries below the lower wing-bar. Although we had this bird under
observation for about five minutes, the bird disappeared as soon as PT got
out her camera to take photos and we were never able to relocate it. To my
knowledge, this is only the second Hutton’s Vireo to be found in Imperial
County.
