       I spent Tuesday, 23 October 2018 (6:45 AM to 5:15 PM), checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in Brawley, checking the hummingbird feeders on
Willard Avenue, then spending a little time in Cattle Call Park and in
Riverview Cemetery as I headed northward. I then stopped at Wiest Lake on
my way to Ramer Lake. From Rammer Lake I drove northward through Calipatria
to the IID Wetlands. After spending time in the northeastern corner of the
IID Wetlands, I proceeded northward into Niland. In Niland I birded
northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south
along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, English, Pound,
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, stopping briefly to look at the wet
area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. From there I drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and between Obsidian Butte and the west end of Young Road. I then
drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge.
From there I drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley where I
again looked for passerines in Riverview Cemetery. I then drove south on
Forrester Road, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir, before stopping at
Sunbeam Lake and ending the day at Fig Lagoon.
      There were no clouds, little to no wind, and temperatures ranging from
65 to 90 degrees.
