      I spent most of Wednesday, 29 June 2016 (5:30 AM-2:00 PM) in the
Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I
started the day with a brief stop in Brawley to look at the hummingbird
feeders on Willard Avenue. I then proceeded northward to Ramer Lake, and on
northward through Calipatria to Niland. In Niland I birded north along
International Avenue, then westward along 4th Street and southward along
Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Pound, Davis Roads and
Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for birds on
Morton Bay. I then drove southward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge HQ and Rock Hill, driving through the Hazard unit on the way. From
here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from
Obsidian Butte southwestward to the west end of Young Road, spending time
in the area around Obsidian Butte and the intersection of Lack and Lindsey
Roads. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge and the north end of Poe Road. From here I drove south
eastward through Westmorland into Brawley and southwestward to the
intersection of Carter and Fites Roads, then southward, stopping briefly at
Sunbeam Lake, Lakeview Golf Course and Fig Lagoon before leaving the
Imperial Valley. It was mostly clear, but with scattered clouds, some wind
from the southeast, mostly in the morning, and with temperatures ranging
from 80 to 110 degrees.
