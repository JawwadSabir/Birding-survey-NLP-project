      I spent Saturday, 5 November 2016 (7:00 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golf Course and Sunbeam Lake, then continued
northward into Brawley, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir and the area around
the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way. In Brawly I looked
briefly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and in Cattle Call
Park (trees unfortunately heavily pruned). I then continued northward into
Niland, stopping at the algae farm adjacent to Highway 111 south of
Sinclair Road on the way. In Niland I birded north along International
Avenue, west along the western part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna
Avenue. I then drove westward by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis, Schrimpf,
Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and
checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock
Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte along the south shore of
the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending time in the area
around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young
Road, and at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I then
drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley, then southward by way
of Forrester Road to Fig Lagoon, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on the way.
It was mostly clear with virtually no wind, and with temperatures ranging
from 60 to 90 degrees.
