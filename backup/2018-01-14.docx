      We (Therese R. Clawson) spent Sunday, 14 January 2017 (6:30 AM to 4:00
PM), birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley and along
the south shore of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon, then
drove northward into Brawley, stopping briefly at Sunbeam Lake, Sheldon
Reservoir and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads
southwest of Brawley. In Brawley we stopped at the hummingbird feeders on
Willard Avenue and spent a little time in Cattle Call Park. From Brawley we
continued northward to the IID Wetlands near Niland, stopping at Young
Reservoir southeast of Calipatria, and the Earthrise Nutritionales
Faciility north of Calipatria on the way. At the IID Wetlands we spent time
looking for land-birds in the riparian growth at the northeast corner of
the Wetlands and a short time elsewhere. We then continued northward into
Niland, where we birded northward along International Avenue, west along
4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue. From there we drove southwestward
by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. From there we
continued southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge. We then returned to Brawley where we had dinner, then drove
westward to San Diego.

with temperatures ranging from 45 to 75 degrees.
