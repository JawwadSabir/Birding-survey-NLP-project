      I spent Friday 19 July 2019 (5:30 AM to 5:30 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward through Brawley to
Ramer Lake (south section mostly dry with many herons). From Ramer Lake I
continued northward through Calipatria to the IID Wetlands, spending some
time at the northeastern corner. From the IID Wetlands I continued north
into Niland. In Niland I birded northward along International Avenue, west
along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there I drove
northwestward by way of Alcot and English Roads and Highway 111 to the
Wister Unit HQ. From there I drove south on Davis Road to the wet area at
the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads, then drove southwestward on
Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay. From Morton Bay I drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. I spent a little time around the Refuge HQ buildings
and looking at the ponds adjacent to Rock Hill. I then checked for water
birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair
Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young
Road. I then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge, spending time there sorting through shorebirds. From Unit
1 I drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley. In Brawley I
quickly looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, at the hummingbird feeders
on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call Park. I then drove south on Road to
the southeast corner of El Centro, then west to Sunbeam Lake, and ended the
day at Fig Lagoon.

ranging from 75 to 110 degrees.
