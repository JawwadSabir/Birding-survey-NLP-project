      We (Justyn T. Stahl) spent Saturday 9 March 2019 (5:45 AM to 5:45 PM)
checking a few locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore
of the Salton Sea. We started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam Lake, then
drove northward into Brawley, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir and the
area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way. In
Brawley we quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue,
spent a short time in Cattle Call Park and drove once around Riverview
Cemetery. From Brawley we drove northward to Calipatria, stopping briefly
at Wiest Lake and Young Reservoir on the way. After looking around the area
immediately west of Calipatria, we drove northward to the area along the
southeast shore of the Salton Sea at the intersection of Pound and Davis
Roads. From there we drove southwestward by way of Davis, Schrimpf, Garst
and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After
walking out to the waterfowl ponds at Rock Hill, we continued southeastward
along the shore of the Salton Sea, looking for waterbirds between the west
end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and between Obsidian Butte and the
west end of Young Road. We then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton
Sea National Wildlife Refuge. After spending time there we drove
southeastward into Westmorland, then southward to a location near the
southeast corner of El Centro, stopping for a second look at Sheldon
Reservoir on the way. From El Centro we drove west, and quickly looked at
Lakeview Golfcourse before ending the day at Fig Lagoon.

temperatures ranging from 45 to 70 degrees.
