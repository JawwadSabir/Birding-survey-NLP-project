      I spent part of Saturday, 18 November 2017 (6:00 AM to 3:00 PM)
birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the
south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon and Sunbeam
Lake, then drove northward to Wiest Lake, stopping at Sheldon Reservoir on
the way. I then continued northward to Niland, stopping at Young Reservoir
and a couple of locations west of Calipatria, and passing through the IID
Wetlands on the way. In Niland I birded northward along International
Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. From there I
drove southwestward by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to
Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around
the Refuge HQ buildings, I checked for water birds along the shore of the
Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. From there I
drove southward to Westmorland, then into Brawley. In Brawley, I looked at
Riverview Cemetery, then quickly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue. I then continued south by way of Forrester Road, stopping at
Sheldon Reservoir, then on southward to Sunbeam Lake, and ending the day at
Fig Lagoon before heading west to San Diego.
      It was clear, with wind between 9:00 AM and 10:30 AM, but otherwise
with light to no wind, and with temperatures ranging from 50 to 80 degrees.
