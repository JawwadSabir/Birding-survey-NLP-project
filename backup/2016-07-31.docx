      I spent Sunday, 31 July 2016 (5:45 AM-4:45 PM) with Justyn T. Stahl in
the Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. We
started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley, then proceeded northward to Ramer Lake,
spending a short time there, then moving on northward through Calipatria to
Niland. In Niland we birded north along International Avenue, then westward
along 4th Street and southward along Luna Avenue. We then drove westward by
way of Pound, Davis Roads and Schrimpf Roads to the north end of Garst Road
and checked for birds on Morton Bay. We then moved southwestward to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. From here we checked for water
birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte
southwestward to the west end of Young Road, spending the most time in the
areas around Obsidian Butte and the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads.
We then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge and on westward to the north end of Poe Road. From here we drove
south eastward through Westmorland into Brawley, spending a little time at
Cattle Call Park in the southwest portion of Brawley. We then proceeded
southward along Dogwood Road to near the southeastern corner of El Centro.
From here we drove west, stopping briefly at Lakeview Golf Course and Fig
Lagoon before leaving the Imperial Valley. It was partially cloudy, with
wind in the morning, humid, and with temperatures ranging from 85 to 110
degrees.
      Numbers of shorebirds appeared less than on 20 July, but we did not
encounter any irrigated fields with shorebirds. However, we did encounter
some early moving passerines such as Ash-throated Flycatchers and Western
Tanagers.
