      I spent Friday, 3 August 2018 (5:45 AM to 5:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day in the area around the intersection of Carter and
Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, then drove northward into Brawley where I
quickly looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue. I was then
joined by Curtis A. Marantz, and drove north to Ramer Lake, stopping at
Riverview Cemetery as we left Brawley. From Ramer Lake we continued
northward to the IID Wetlands south of Niland. From there we continued
northward into Niland where we birded northward along International Avenue,
west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue. We then drove
northwestward by way Highway 111 to the Wister Unit HQ. After birding
around the Wister Unit HQ we drove south through the Wister Unit on Davis
Road and west on Schrimpf Road to Morton Bay, stopping to look at the wet
area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. We then drove
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking at Rock Hill, we checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian
Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. We then drove
southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and the
north end of Poe Road. From there we drove southeastward through
Westmorland into Brawley. Curtis left to drive north, and I drove south by
way of Dogwood Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro. From there I
drove west to Lakeview Golfcourse and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      There were no clouds, virtually no wind, and temperatures ranging from
85 to 115 degrees.

considered to be a female. The head and upper-neck were gray-brown, lacking
obvious markings, including white feathering around the base of the bill,
and the short slightly decurved bill was entirely black. The upper-parts
were noticeably patterned, many of the feathers being dark-centered with
pale fringes, and the tertials being dark with pale golden-brown barring.
