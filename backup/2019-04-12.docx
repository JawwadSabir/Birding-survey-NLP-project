      I spent Friday 12 April 2019 (6:15 AM to 5:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, Lakeview Golfcourse and Sunbeam Lake,
then drove northward towards Brawley, stopping to look at Sheldon Reservoir
and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on the way.
In Brawley I looked for birds at Cattle Call Park. From Brawley I drove
northward through Calipatria, stopping to look for gulls at the west end of
Date Street in Calipatria, into Niland. In Niland I birded northward along
International Avenue, west along 4th Street, and south along Luna Avenue.
From there I drove southwestward by way of Alcott, English and Pound Roads
to the marshy area at the intersection of Pound and Davis Roads. From there
I drove southwestward on Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then
southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the Refuge HQ
buildings and looking around Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the
shore of the Salton Sea from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road,
then drove southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge. I then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley where I
looked for birds in Riverview Cemetery, then drove east to the Alamo River
Wetlands. From there I returned to Brawley then drove south along Dogwood
Road to near the southeast corner of El Centro, stopping at the Branches
Hunting Club on the way. After spending time near the southeast corner of
El Centro, I drove westward and ended the day at Fig Lagoon.
      Partial cloud-cover throughout the day with medium to strong wind,
and with temperatures ranging from 55 to 80 degrees.
      Apart from an obvious movement of warblers near the intersection of
Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley, land-birds were few and far
between – possibly due to the windy conditions.

spring) – 127 species.
      The single (1) Glaucous Gull was well studied as it rested on a small
island with other gulls, including eight Herring Gulls, at the Branches
Hunting Club. The Branches Hunting Club is located east of Dogwood Road
between Keystone and Harris Roads, and the island on which the gulls were
resting is easily viewed from a dike along the northern edge of the club.
This obvious large white gull appeared a little larger than the Herring
Gulls. The eyes were dark suggesting it was not a second-year bird, and the
longish black-tipped pale pink bill was consistent with that of first-year
birds. The unmarked white primaries appeared somewhat worn, the white tail
appeared to lack markings, and I concluded it was somewhat bleached from
exposure to abundant sunlight. I suspect this gull, along with the late-
staying Herring Gulls, is attracted to this area by the nearby sanitary
waste landfill.
