      I spent Wednesday, 18 January (6:30 AM to 4:30 PM) birding select
locations within the Imperial Valley and along part of the south shore of
the Salton Sea. I started the day at Fig Lagoon, then stopped at Sunbeam
Lake and the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads on my
way to Brawley. In Brawley, I looked at the hummingbird feeders on Willard
Avenue and spent a little time in Cattle Call Park. I then drove northward
through Westmorland to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and
looked around Rock Hill. I then looked along the shore from Obsidian Butte
to the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads, then proceeded southwestward
to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I then attempted to
look at the north end of Poe Road but was deterred by mud. From here I
drove southward through Westmorland into Brawley, then southward to
Forrester Road, stopping briefly at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake,
Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before heading west towards San Diego at
about 4:30 PM. There were some high wispy cloud-cover most of the day,
increasing in the afternoon, with virtually no wind, and temperatures
ranging from 40 to 70 degrees.
      The decrease in numbers of Double-crested Cormorants and White
Pelicans along the south shore of the Salton Sea continues, and the virtual
non-existence of Eared, Western and Clark’s Grebes, along with the absence
of Caspian and Forester’s Terns continues. Again, I was unable to find any
Western Sandpipers. Recent heavy rain had left many dirt roads with
standing water and mud, therefore not drivable.
