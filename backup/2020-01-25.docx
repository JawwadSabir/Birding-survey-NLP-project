      On Saturday, 25 January 2020 (11:00 AM to 4:00 PM) after leaving the
Salton Sea State Recreation Area on the northeast shore of the Salton Sea,
we (Therese R. Clawson) drove south, stopping at the Niland Boat Landing,
the Calipatria State Prison, the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, a
portion of the “seawall” between Lindsey Road and the north end of Lack
Road, and Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, on our way to
I-8 and San Diego.
      Species of note included – Greater White-fronted Goose (3 – three with
Snow and Ross’s Geese at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife
Refuge), Tundra Swan (1 – one adult at Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National
Wildlife Refuge was the same bird at the same location seen on 19 January),
Blue-winged Teal (20 – a flock of twenty at the north end of Lack Road was
an unusually large number), Hooded Merganser (5 – five, including an adult
male, at the Calipatria State Prison pond), Red-breasted Merganser (1 – one
adult male on the Salton Sea off the north end of Lack Road), Stilt
Sandpiper (1 – one in basic-plumage on the shore north of the intersection
of Lack and Lindsey Roads), Dunlin (3 – three in basic-plumage at the
Niland Boat Landing), Neotropic Cormorant (3 – three immatures at the
Calipatria State Prison pond) and Vesper Sparrow (1 – one at Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge).
