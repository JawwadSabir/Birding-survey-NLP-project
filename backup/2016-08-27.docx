27 August 2016 - Salton Sea/Imperial Valley, Imperial County.

      I spent Saturday, 27 August 2016 (6:15 AM-4:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at the intersection of Carter and Fites Roads southwest of Brawley then
moved north to Ramer Lake. I then continued moving northward through
Calipatria to the IID Wetlands near Niland, stopping at the algae farm on
the way. I then went northward into Niland where I birded north along
International Avenue, then westward along 4th Street and southward along
Luna Avenue. I then drove westward by way Pound, Davis Roads and Schrimpf
Roads to the north end of Garst Road and checked for birds on Morton Bay. I
then moved southwestward to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ.
From here I checked for water birds along the shoreline of the Salton Sea
from the area east of Obsidian Butte southwestward to the west end of Young
Road, spending the most time in the areas around the eastern side of
Obsidian Butte and at the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads. I then
drove southeastward towards Brawley, stopping along the way at irrigated
fields north of Westmorland and southwest of Finney Lake. I then spent time
at Cattle Call Park and elsewhere around the southwest portion of Brawley.
From here I proceeded southward to the southeast corner of El Centro where
I spent about one-hour, then stopped at Lakeview Golf Course and Fig Lagoon
before leaving the Imperial Valley. It was clear in the morning, but with
scattered clouds and some wind in the afternoon, and with temperatures
ranging from 75 to 100 degrees.
      Numbers of shorebirds appeared to have decreased in the past four
days, and I failed to find any fields attracting Long-billed Curlews. Black
Skimmers and Gull-billed Terns have evidently moved out of the area. Most
of the White-winged Doves have departed, and the latest-staying Black-
chinned Hummingbirds are hard to find. However, the number and variety of
migrant passerines in areas of suitable habitat made for an interesting
day.
