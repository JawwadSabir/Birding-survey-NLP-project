      We (Rosie and Chris Howard from Bishop in Inyo County) spent Monday, 3
April 2017 (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM), birding a few select locations along the
south shore of the Salton Sea and within the Imperial Valley. We started
the day at Ramer Lake, then moved north into Niland, stopping briefly in
Calipatria and at the IID Wetlands on the way. In Niland we birded
northward along International Avenue, west along the western part of 4th
Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. We then drove westward by way of
Alcott, Pound, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then south on Garst
and west on Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ
and Rock Hill. We then checked for water birds along the shoreline of the
Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and, from Obsidian Butte along
the south shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of Poe Road, spending a
little time in the area around the intersection of Lack and Lindsey Roads,
within Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge and at Carter
Reservoir. We then drove southeastward through Westmorland into Brawley.
From Brawley we drove south on Dogwood Road to near the southeastern corner
of El Centro. After spending time in El Centro, we moved west, and looked
at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon before calling it a day.
      There was some scattered high cloud-cover, with minimal wind most of
the day, but increasing to a strong wind from the west in the late
afternoon, and with temperatures ranging from 55 to 90 degrees.
