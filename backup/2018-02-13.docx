      I spent Thursday, 13 February 2019 (6:15 AM to 4:45 PM) checking a few
locations in the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton
Sea. I started the day at Sheldon Reservoir, then moved northward into
Brawley, stopping in the area around the intersection of Carter and Fites
Roads southwest of Brawley on the way. In Brawley I stopped at the
hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue, spent some time in Cattle Call Park
and drove around Riverview Cemetery. From Brawley I drove northwestward to
Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge, spending some time
around the viewing platform. I then moved westward to the north end of Poe
Road where large numbers of shorebirds were visible along the shore. From
Poe Road I drove northeastward to the west end of Young Road and worked my
way northeastward along the shore of the Salton Sea to Obsidian Butte. I
then looked for birds around the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ and
at Rock Hill. From there I continued northeastward to the intersection of
Pound and Davis Roads by way of Sinclair, Garst and Schrimpf Roads. I then
drove eastward on McDonald Road to Highway 111 and jogging east to look at
the area around the Calipatria State Prison, then southwestward to the area
immediately west of Calipatria. From there I drove to Wiest Lake and
continued southward through Brawley to Sheldon Reservoir, ending the day at
Fig Lagoon.

ranging from 45 to 65 degrees.
