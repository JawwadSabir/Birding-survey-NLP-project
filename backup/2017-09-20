I spent Wednesday, 20 August 2017 (6:30 AM to 5:30 PM) birding a few select locations within the Imperial Valley and along the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the day at Ramer Lake, then drove north to the IID Wetlands near Niland. From there I drove northward into Niland, where I birded northward along International Avenue, west along 4th Street, then south along Luna Avenue. I then drove south by way of Highway 111 to an area south of Calipatria where I looked at an irrigated field (nothing of note). I then returned northward to the area around the intersection of Sperry and Bowles Roads west of Calipatria. From there I drove northwestward by way of English, McDonald, Davis and Schrimpf Roads to Morton Bay, then southwestward by way of Garst and Sinclair Roads to the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ. After spending a little time around the refuge HQ buildings and Rock Hill, I checked for water birds along the shore of the Salton Sea between the west end of Sinclair Road and Obsidian Butte, and from Obsidian Butte to the west end of Young Road. I then continued southwestward to Unit 1 of the Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. From there I drove southeastward through Westmorland to Brawley. In Brawley, I looked at Riverview Cemetery, then quickly at the hummingbird feeders on Willard Avenue and at Cattle Call Park. I then continued south by way of Dogwood Road to the southeastern corner of El Centro where I spent about one hour. Then, on my way west to San Diego, I stopped briefly at Lakeview Golfcourse and Fig Lagoon.
