      I spent Tuesday, 6 December 2016 (6:30 AM-3:30 PM) in the Imperial
Valley and along part of the south shore of the Salton Sea. I started the
day at Ramer Lake then drove northward through Calipatria to the algae farm
adjacent to Highway 111 south of Sinclair Road, and eastward to the area
around the Calipatria State Prison. From here I drove northward to Niland.
In Niland I birded north along International Avenue, west along the western
part of 4th Street, and southward along Luna Avenue. I then drove westward
by way of Alcott, Pound, Davis, Schrimpf, Garst and Sinclair Roads to the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge HQ, and checked for water birds along
the shoreline of the Salton Sea from Rock Hill to Obsidian Butte, and from
Obsidian Butte along the south shore of the Salton Sea to the north end of
Poe Road, spending a little time in the area around the intersection of
Lack and Lindsey Roads, the west end of Young Road, and at Unit 1 of the
Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge. I then drove southeastward into
Westmorland, then southward by way of Forrester Road to Fig Lagoon,
stopping at Sheldon Reservoir, Sunbeam Lake and Lakeview Golfcourse on the
way. It was mostly overcast with virtually no wind through the morning, but
with wind increasing in the afternoon to a strong wind from the west at the
time I departed, and with temperatures ranging from 45 to 70 degrees.
      Land-birds continue in lower than expected numbers, and became
increasingly difficult to observe in the afternoon.
